<h2 class="eee">PREFACE</h2>
<p>In an earlier volume, I recited the history of the
Disciples of Christ under the title, <i>Religion Follows
the Frontier</i>. The phrase was designed to emphasize
the fact that this religious movement was born under
pioneer conditions on the American frontier, in the
days when the frontier was just crossing the Alleghenies,
that much of its formative thinking followed patterns
congenial to the frontier mind, and that its early
expansion kept pace with the westward wave of migration.</p>
<p>Since that book is now out of print, while interest
in the theme is increasing, it has seemed desirable to
rewrite the history. If this were merely a sequel to
the other, I would call it <i>Growing Up with the Country</i>.</p>
<p>It remains true that the pioneer beginnings must be
remembered and understood if the initial motives and
methods of the Disciples and the processes of their
growth are to be understood. But important as the
frontier is, as a fact in the history of the United States
and of every phase of culture in the Middle West, an
equally significant fact is that, as the frontier rolled
westward, it left behind it a widening area in which
pioneer conditions no longer prevailed. As the country
was growing by the expansive drive of which the
frontier was the cutting edge, it was also growing up,
both behind and on the frontier. The process of maturing
is as significant as that of expanding.</p>
<p>Since the present purpose is to survey the history
of the Disciples through both of these phases, I have
resisted the allurement of this second title and am
giving the book a name which includes both; for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
movement is distinctively American, and every American
movement which began in pioneer days and has
lived through the cycles of American life until now has
both followed the frontier and grown up with the
country.</p>
<p>As to the future&mdash;I am only a historian, not a
prophet. But I shall be disappointed if this record of
the past does not leave with the reader an acquaintance
with the essential data upon which, using his own
judgment and imagination, he will be disposed to
project the curve of a future development far beyond
any present attainments in promoting the ends for
which the Disciples of Christ came into existence&mdash;the
unity and purity of the Church, a reasonable and
practical religion, and the enrichment of life through
fellowship in the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="large">PRELUDE</span></h2>
<p>Who are these &ldquo;Disciples of Christ&rdquo;? What are
these &ldquo;Christian Churches&rdquo; or &ldquo;Churches of
Christ&rdquo; which now constitute one of the major religious
groups in the United States? When, where,
and how did they begin, and how have they become
what they are?</p>
<p>They began early in the nineteenth century with the
union of two separate movements, one of which had
close kinship with two others. All four were alike in
aiming to simplify the complexities of Christian faith
and in going back of the creeds and the traditional
practices of existing churches to the plain teaching of
the New Testament. They believed that this was easy
to understand, and that the divisions of Christendom
would disappear if Christians would only agree to
speak as the apostles spoke and to do as they did.
They believed that man was sinful and needed God&rsquo;s
salvation; but they did not believe him to be so depraved
by &ldquo;original sin&rdquo; that he could not, by the act
of his own intelligence and by his own free will, accept
the means of grace that have been provided.
They wanted all the churches to unite on the basis of
the simple and clear requirements of discipleship as
given in the New Testament, leaving all doubtful and
inferential matters in the field of &ldquo;opinion,&rdquo; in which
every Christian should exercise liberty, and scrap the
machinery of synods and bishops, for which they found
no warrant in Scripture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Of the two main movements, the name of Barton W.
Stone was most prominent in one; the names of
Thomas and Alexander Campbell in the other. Stone&rsquo;s
movement (1804) began earlier than that of the Campbells
(1809), but later than two others practically
identical with it. But the Campbells&rsquo; was the more
dynamic, especially after it gained the advocacy of
Walter Scott, who set the pattern for its evangelism.
These are the four great names in the early history
of the Disciples&mdash;Stone, Thomas Campbell, Alexander
Campbell, and Scott. All four had been Presbyterians.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">A Preview</span></h3>
<p>Stone was a native American of old colonial stock,
born in Maryland, educated in North Carolina after
spending most of his boyhood in Virginia. He did his
most important work in Kentucky. Thomas and Alexander
Campbell, father and son, were born in North
Ireland, were educated at Glasgow University, and
came to America only a short time before the launching
of their reformatory movement. The influences
seen in their work are those of a British background
and an American environment. The center of their
activity was the southwest corner of Pennsylvania,
eastern Ohio, and the narrow strip of Virginia (now
West Virginia) that lies between them. Walter Scott,
born in Scotland and educated in the University of
Edinburgh, came to America as a young man and was
a teacher in Pittsburgh when he received the impulse
which led him into the Campbell movement while it
was still in its initial stage.</p>
<p>Soon the followers of the Campbells, most of whom
had recently been Baptists, and the associates of
Stone, many of whom had been Presbyterians, discovered
the identity of their programs, and the two movements
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
flowed together into one. Stone&rsquo;s &ldquo;Christians,&rdquo;
chiefly in Kentucky and Tennessee, plus the Baptists
who had joined Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Reformers&rdquo; and were beginning
to call themselves &ldquo;Disciples,&rdquo; plus the hundreds
of converts who had already responded to the
faith-repentance-and-baptism evangelism of Scott and
the others who had learned to preach as he did, added
up to twenty or thirty thousand by the time of this
union in 1832. From that point, growth was rapid, by
persistent and persuasive preaching, by propaganda
in print, and by the constant movement of population
to new frontiers farther and farther west carrying
with it the nuclei of new churches in the new settlements.</p>
<p>This was at first a popular movement, unorganized
and uncontrolled, with no high command, no common
treasury, no general machinery for either promotion
or direction. But the increasing magnitude of the enterprise,
the changing social conditions as the Middle
West grew out of its frontier stage, and the realization
that such a religious body as this was coming to be had
some responsibilities other than propagating itself&mdash;all
these things made organization inevitable. Then
followed colleges, missionary societies, conventions,
and the other apparatus of an organic fellowship. But
still, and always, there was fierce resistance to anything
that seemed to threaten encroachment upon the
liberty of the Christian individual or of the local congregation.
Cooperation must always be voluntary.</p>
<p>So the Disciples of Christ have become &ldquo;a great
people.&rdquo; It is to their credit that there has always
been some confusion about their name. Aiming to
promote union, they wanted a scriptural name that all
Christians might use. They found in the New Testament
certain terms applied to the undivided church
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
or to its members. Alexander Campbell liked the name
&ldquo;Disciples.&rdquo; Stone preferred &ldquo;Christians.&rdquo; A local
church is commonly called a &ldquo;Christian Church,&rdquo; or
a &ldquo;Church of Christ&rdquo;; less frequently a &ldquo;Church of
Disciples of Christ.&rdquo; The name &ldquo;Churches of Christ&rdquo;
(in the plural), as the designation for a group, generally
refers to the conservative or antimissionary-society
churches which became completely separated
from the main body in 1906.</p>
<p>But, though it is well to have unsectarian names
which any Christian or any Christian church can use,
it is highly convenient to have some designation which
others do not generally use, so that the public will
know what is meant when reference is made to the
churches or members of this movement. Its objective
may be the unity of all Christ&rsquo;s followers, but meanwhile
it is a specific group, if not a denomination then
a &ldquo;brotherhood&rdquo;&mdash;and a brotherhood is just as distinct
an entity as a denomination. So, as a term that
will be generally understood to mean <i>us</i>, the term
&ldquo;Disciples of Christ&rdquo; has come into common use.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Three Sources, Two Streams</span></h3>
<p>Looking back from a later time to describe the reformatory
movement as it had been in the 1820&rsquo;s,
Walter Scott wrote that there were then &ldquo;three parties
struggling to restore original Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>first</i> of these was the independent &ldquo;Churches of
Christ,&rdquo; which stemmed from the work of Glas, Sandeman,
the Haldane brothers, and similar eighteenth
century British restorers of primitive Christianity.
Scott himself for a time belonged to one of these
churches in Pittsburgh. They were few in number,
had little relation to each other, little concern for
union, and no evangelistic drive. This party is important
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
for our purpose because it is one of the sources
from which the Campbells derived suggestions for a
rational conception of faith and the idea of &ldquo;restoration&rdquo;
in its more legalistic and literalistic aspects. It
will be described more particularly in the latter part of
Chapter II.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> was the &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; churches, existing
in three independent groups in Virginia and North
Carolina, in New England, New York, and Pennsylvania,
and in Kentucky and adjacent states. The last
of these divisions is doubtless the one Scott had chiefly
in mind, and it is the one most closely related to our
theme. Some account of these three bodies of &ldquo;Christians&rdquo;
will be given in Chapter IV.</p>
<p>The <i>third</i>, said Scott, &ldquo;originating with the writings
and labors of Bro. A. Campbell,&rdquo; was at that time
&ldquo;chiefly in the bosom of the Regular Baptist
churches.&rdquo; Chapters V and VI will tell the story
of these &ldquo;Reformers&rdquo; down to the time of their separation
from the Baptists.</p>
<p>The first of these is significant as an influence and
as part of the historical background. It contributed
to the united movement few churches, few men, and
no literature; but two of the men who came to the
Disciples through this channel were invaluable&mdash;Walter
Scott and Isaac Errett. The other two parties
became substantial bodies, and they are the two main
streams whose confluence produced the Disciples of
Christ.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="large">IDEAS WITH A HISTORY: UNION AND RESTORATION</span></h2>
<p>The union of all Christians and the restoration of
primitive Christianity were the two main ideas
announced by Thomas Campbell in his <i>Declaration
and Address</i> in 1809 and championed by Alexander
Campbell for fifty years thereafter. With some differences
of emphasis and phrasing, they were the
ruling ideas of Stone and the other reformers whose
work preceded, paralleled, and reinforced his. To
this day, these are the two foci of interest among Disciples,
and every difference of opinion which threatens
to create parties among them revolves about answers
to the questions: &ldquo;Restoration of what?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What
price union?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of these ideas, union and restoration, has a
long history, only a small part of which can be told
here, but part of which must be told.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">The Idea of Union</span></h3>
<p>The essential unity of the church was and is a basic
principle of Roman Catholicism. It was a formative
idea in the Catholic Church of the second and third
centuries, which had not yet become Roman, and it continued
to be so through all the history of the imperial
church of the Middle Ages. The great Protestant
reformers of the sixteenth century did not cease to
be &ldquo;catholic&rdquo; in their belief that the church was divinely
intended to be one body. They wanted to reform
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
the church, not to break it into pieces. Efforts to
heal the breach with Rome were long continued and
frequently renewed. But reunion with Rome proved
to be impossible on any other terms than submission
to that usurped authority from which they had revolted.
Different types of Protestantism soon appeared.
The principal varieties&mdash;Lutheranism, Calvinism,
Zwinglianism, Anabaptism, episcopal Anglicanism&mdash;represented,
not divisions of an originally
united Protestantism, but separate and independent
revolts from Rome. Among these there was a long
series of conferences, negotiations, and proposals designed
to unite, if possible, all Protestants into one
body. Such efforts continued to be made throughout
the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, most
people believed that a nation could not be politically
united unless it had only one church, of which all its
people were members. Consequently, the power of the
state was generally used to support one church and
to suppress all others. &ldquo;Dissenters&rdquo; were subjected
to various degrees of pressure or restraint to induce
them to conform to the established church. Only
gradually did dissenters gain liberty of conscience.
The intolerance and persecution of which they were the
victims meanwhile proved the importance that was attached
to the unity of the church, at least within the
limits of each nation. This kind of unity without liberty,
or compulsory religious unity conceived as an
instrument of social control and as essential to political
stability, was the expression of a social philosophy
which was carried over from medieval Roman Catholic
Europe to the modern European nations, both Catholic
and Protestant. The idea of unity as an important
characteristic of the church did not need to be invented
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
or even discovered in modern times. It was there all
the while. But it needed to be liberated from its
political entanglements, as the church itself did. It
needed to be conceived in terms consistent with the
spiritual nature of the church and the civil rights of
man. Both the church and the citizen had to be made
free.</p>
<p>Besides the efforts of politicians and ecclesiastics in
established churches to get church unity by compulsion,
there were a few churchmen and independent
thinkers who argued that unity might be attained by
requiring agreement only upon the few saving essentials
of Christianity and leaving everyone free to
hold his own opinions on all the doubtful and disputatious
matters of doctrine, polity, and ritual. Thus the
Puritan Stillingfleet wrote in his <i>Eirenicon</i> (1662):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would bee strange the Church should require
more than Christ himself did, and make other
conditions of her communion than our Savior
did of Discipleship.... Without all controversie,
the main in-let of all the distractions, confusions
and divisions of the Christian world hath been
by adding other conditions of Church-communion
than Christ hath done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In very similar words, and only a few years later,
the English philosopher John Locke argued that, since
men differ in their interpretations of the Bible and
always will, none should seek to impose his opinions
on another, and that their differences should not divide
them. In his first <i>Letter Concerning Toleration</i>
(1689), Locke wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since men are so solicitous about the true
church, I would only ask them here by the way,
if it be not more agreeable to the Church of Christ
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
to make the conditions of her communion consist
in such things, and such things only, as the
Holy Spirit has in the Holy Scriptures declared,
in express words, to be necessary to salvation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Rupertius Meldenius made the classic statement
of this principle when he said: &ldquo;In essentials, unity;
in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the churches did not respond to this appeal for
liberty of opinion within the church that there might
be union of Christians in one church. Slowly, however,
the governments of most European countries in
which the Roman Catholic Church did not exercise
control yielded to the demand for liberty of religious
opinion within the state. With this grant of toleration
to churches which were mutually intolerant, the
states preserved their unity, while the church sank
into a condition of complacent sectarianism. During
the seventeenth century there had been many pleas
for church unity through liberty. The eighteenth
century thought much about liberty and little about
unity. But it is to be remembered that, when a new
call to unity was sounded in America at the beginning
of the nineteenth century, it was the renewal of a campaign
that already had a long history. It came at a
time when the churches in America, happy in the complete
liberty they enjoyed and in their freedom from
state control and equality before the law, had ceased
to be much concerned about unity and had settled into
the conviction that division and denominationalism
represented the normal condition of the church.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">The Idea of Restoration</span></h3>
<p>The other principle stressed by &ldquo;the reformation of
the nineteenth century&rdquo; was the restoration of primitive
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Christianity. That also had a long history, which
can be only sketched. Thomas and Alexander Campbell
made a new use of this idea, and it will have a
large place in the story of their work, but in order to
understand their contribution it is necessary to note
that the idea itself was not new. The oldest Christian
bodies claim to have preserved primitive Christianity
uncorrupted, and every reforming movement in the
history of the church has claimed in some sense to
offer a restoration of its pristine purity. A few citations,
among many that might be offered, will make
this clear.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church professes to present
original Christianity unchanged. &ldquo;What Christ made
it in the beginning, that must it ever remain,&rdquo; says
Rev. B. J. Otten, S.J., in <i>The Catholic Church and
Modern Christianity</i>. A representative of the Eastern
Orthodox Church more recently wrote: &ldquo;The Russian
Church, having alone preserved the picture of Christ,
must restore that picture to Europe.&rdquo; A Chinese
Nestorian who visited Europe in the thirteenth century
said to the College of Cardinals: &ldquo;As for us
Orientals, the Holy Apostles taught us, and up to the
present we hold fast to what they have committed to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great reformers of the sixteenth century conceived
of their work as clearing away the human additions
and getting back to primitive Christianity as
found in the Bible. Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin all
made their appeal directly to Scripture. Bucer exhorted
believers to &ldquo;reject all false speculations and
all human opinions.&rdquo; The Anabaptists cited the example
of the first Christians as their authority for
refusing to have a creed or to bear arms or to take
oaths or to hold civil office, and Melchior Hofmann announced
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
a &ldquo;resurrection of primitive Christianity.&rdquo;
When Queen Elizabeth was masquerading as a Lutheran,
for diplomatic reasons, she said she would hold to
the Augsburg Confession because it &ldquo;conformed most
closely to the faith of the early church.&rdquo; Chillingworth
stated the principle of the Reformation in the
words, &ldquo;The Bible and the Bible alone is the religion
of Protestants,&rdquo; excluding ecclesiastical tradition because
it furnished neither legitimate additions to the
primitive faith and practice nor trustworthy evidence
as to what these had been. Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
and Congregationalists, in seventeenth-century
England, all claimed the authority and example of the
New Testament church in support of their respective
forms of church organization and their conceptions of
the ministry.</p>
<p>One modern Lutheran writer declares that &ldquo;the
Lutheran Church is the old original church,&rdquo; and another
that &ldquo;Lutheranism is Bible Christianity.&rdquo; A
book issued by the Presbyterian Board of Publication
says that &ldquo;of all the churches now existing in the
world, the Presbyterian Church comes nearest to the
apostolic model.&rdquo; John Wesley wrote to the Methodists
in America after the Revolution that, being free
from the English state and hierarchy, they &ldquo;are now
at full liberty to follow the Scriptures and the primitive
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More secular thinkers have made similar appeal to
the ancient standards as the cure for the modern
church&rsquo;s ills. Rousseau &ldquo;only wanted to simplify
Christianity and bring it back to its origins,&rdquo; says
A. Aulard in his work on <i>Christianity and the French
Revolution</i>. John Adams wrote in 1770: &ldquo;Where do
we find a precept in the Gospel requiring ecclesiastical
synods, councils, creeds, oaths, subscriptions, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
whole cart-loads of other trumpery that we find religion
encumbered with in these days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These references do not, of course, prove that all
or any of those who claimed to follow the primitive
model actually did so. The point is that they claimed
to do it. The restoration of primitive purity has been
the standard formula for reformation.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Eighteenth Century Restorationists</span></h3>
<p>In the eighteenth century there arose, in Great
Britain, some movements which applied the restoration
formula in a way that contributed more directly
to the Campbells&rsquo; use of it than those already mentioned.
None of these gained a large following, and
even their names have been forgotten by all except
special students of the period. Their leaders were
bold and independent spirits who saw that the church
needed reforming and were not afraid to attempt it.
They laid hold of a great idea, but they were never able
to build a substantial enterprise upon it. Yet they
handed it down to those who could.</p>
<p>John Glas, a minister of the Church of Scotland,
about 1727 came to the conviction that, since the New
Testament church had no connection with the state,
the whole scheme of establishment as embodied in
the &ldquo;National Covenant&rdquo; was without authority.
Further, he found no warrant for synods or other
law-making bodies with power to fix standards of
doctrine for the whole church and exercise discipline
over it. He therefore left the state church and organized
an independent congregation. He next inquired
how this autonomous local church should order
its affairs, conduct its worship, and establish its ministry.
Finding that the New Testament churches
&ldquo;came together on the first day of the week to break
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
bread,&rdquo; whereas the Presbyterian Church of Scotland
observed the Lord&rsquo;s Supper no oftener than once a
month, Glas and his associates adopted the practice
of weekly communion. &ldquo;They agreed that in this, as
in everything else,&rdquo; says his biographer, &ldquo;they ought
to be followers of the first Christians, being guided and
directed by the Scriptures alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, Glas found that in the early churches there
was a &ldquo;plurality of elders&rdquo; and that &ldquo;mutual edification&rdquo;
was practiced&mdash;that is, that public services of
worship were not conducted solely by one ordained
minister. This opened the way for a large degree of
lay leadership and less emphasis on the special functions
of the clergy. After it was observed that the
Epistles of Paul made no mention of a university education
or a knowledge of the ancient languages among
the qualifications for the eldership, the line between
clergy and laity grew still more dim.</p>
<p>Robert Sandeman, who married one of Glas&rsquo;s
daughters, adopted his principles and gave them a
somewhat more vigorous advocacy, so that the resulting
churches were more often called &ldquo;Sandemanian&rdquo;
than &ldquo;Glasite.&rdquo; Through their combined efforts,
there came into existence a few small churches, probably
never more than a dozen or two, in various parts
of Scotland and England. Michael Faraday, the
famous chemist, was a member of a Sandemanian
church in London. Apparently not more than six or
eight such churches were organized in America, and
not all these were known by that name or acknowledged
any special connection with Glas or Sandeman. Their
basic theory led them to &ldquo;call no man master&rdquo; and
to exercise their liberty in deciding, from their own
study of Scripture, what should be their faith and
practice. Robert Sandeman spent his last years in
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Danbury, Connecticut, where he died in 1771, after
organizing a church there. There were Sandemanian
churches in Boston. All of them in this country, so
far as known, were in New England.</p>
<p>Glas and Sandeman did not find that the New Testament
churches practiced only the immersion of believers
as baptism. But some of their associates in
Scotland did. Archibald McLean was the leader of
these. They came to be called &ldquo;Old Scotch Baptists.&rdquo;
In coming to this position they seem not to have been
influenced by the English Baptists but were moved by
their own independent study of the New Testament.
Similarly, some of the members of Sandeman&rsquo;s church
in Danbury later reached the same conviction, withdrew,
and formed an immersionist &ldquo;Church of
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the Sandemanians remained few and inconspicuous,
Robert Sandeman himself was a theological
thinker of great ability and clarity. His writings
were widely read and highly regarded by many
who had no affiliation with his movement and who did
not share his views about the importance of reproducing
exactly the model of the primitive church.
This was especially true of his treatises dealing with
the nature of faith and with the priority of faith to
repentance. If this now seems a dry and technical
matter, it did not seem so then and it had very practical
implications. The gist of his thought on this
point was that it is within the power of every man to
believe the gospel and obey its commands to his own
salvation. The more popular theory among eighteenth-century
evangelicals was that sinful and &ldquo;fallen&rdquo;
man has no power to believe. He can repent and
&ldquo;mourn&rdquo; for the sinful state which he inherited from
Adam, but then he must wait for a special and miraculous
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
act of enabling grace to give him faith. This gift
of faith and regeneration will be certified to him by
an exalted state of feeling which constitutes his religious
experience and is the evidence of his &ldquo;acceptance
with God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Against this, Sandeman put the doctrine that God
had not only revealed his truth in terms intelligible
to man and provided the means of salvation through
Christ, but had also furnished in Scripture adequate
evidence of the truth of his revelation, so that the
natural man, just as he is, with all his sins, can weigh
the evidence and accept the truth. That acceptance
is faith. Saving faith, said Sandeman, is an act of
man&rsquo;s reason, and it differs from any other act of
belief only in being belief of a saving fact.</p>
<p>This view of faith came to have immense importance
in the history of the Disciples. They developed from
it, as Sandeman did not, the method of a very successful
evangelism. There were other influences besides
that of Sandeman which led Alexander Campbell
to this view, especially the philosophy of John Locke
and, above all, his own study of the New Testament.
But it is known that he had read Sandeman&rsquo;s writings
carefully in his youth and regarded them highly, and
the similarity of his view to Sandeman&rsquo;s on this point
cannot be regarded as purely coincidental. A Baptist
writer later tried to prove that the Disciples were
&ldquo;an offshoot of Sandemanianism.&rdquo; (Whitsitt: <i>The
Origin of the Disciples of Christ</i>, 1888.) &ldquo;Offshoot&rdquo;
is the wrong word; a mighty river is not an offshoot
from a tiny trickle. But there was undoubtedly an
influence: first, in the emphasis upon restoring the
procedure of the primitive church; second, in the
conception of faith as intelligent belief based on evidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Restoration and Division</span></h3>
<p>Two wealthy brothers, Robert and James Alexander
Haldane, laymen of the Church of Scotland, became
alarmed at the state of religion in their country. It
seemed to them that the church had become merely a
respectable institution enjoying the patronage of the
state, supporting a clergy chiefly concerned about
their own professional dignity and privileges, and doing
little to carry a vital gospel to those who needed
it most. At their own expense, while still members of
the Church of Scotland, they attempted to start a mission
to India (which was frustrated by the East India
Company), brought twenty-four native children from
Africa to be educated in England and sent back to
evangelize their own people (but the Anglican Church
took them over), built tabernacles for evangelistic
meetings, sent agents through Scotland to organize
Sunday schools, and established institutes for the
training of lay preachers. Beginning with no very
definite theology or theory about the church, they
gradually came to the belief that the chief trouble
with the church was its departure from the primitive
pattern as described in the New Testament.</p>
<p>In 1799 the Haldane brothers withdrew from the
Church of Scotland and organized an independent
church in Edinburgh. Acting on the advice of Greville
Ewing, a minister who was in charge of their training
school in Glasgow, they adopted the congregational
form of organization and the weekly communion as
being in accordance with the usage of the apostolic
churches. Soon they became earnest advocates of the
restoration of primitive Christianity by following in
all respects the pattern of the New Testament
churches. J. A. Haldane published, in 1805, a book
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
entitled, <i>A View of the Social Worship and Ordinances
of the First Christians, Drawn from the Scriptures
alone; Being an Attempt to Enforce their Divine Obligation,
and to Represent the Guilty and Evil Consequences
of Neglecting them</i>. This book contains an
argument for infant baptism on the ground that it was
the apostolic practice, but two years later the Haldanes
decided that the evidence of Scripture was against this
position, so they gave it up and were immersed.</p>
<p>Other Haldanean churches sprang up, both in Great
Britain and in America. There were never many of
them. No organization bound them together, they had
no cooperative work, and they took no distinctive name.
But they swelled the number of those scattered and
independent &ldquo;Churches of Christ&rdquo; which were attempting,
with somewhat differing results, to restore
the primitive order. The tendency of all these churches
was toward a rather literalistic and legalistic interpretation
of Scripture, with special emphasis upon
exact conformity to a pattern of ordinances, organization,
and worship. A few years later, two of these
churches, one in Edinburgh and the other in New York,
engaged in an earnest but very courteous argument by
correspondence as to whether the New Testament commanded
that the worship service be opened with a
hymn or with a prayer. Each quoted what seemed
relevant and convincing texts: &ldquo;First of all giving
thanks&rdquo; meant prayer first; &ldquo;Enter into his courts
with praise&rdquo; meant hymn first.</p>
<p>The Sandemanian churches also, in their anxiety to
do everything exactly as the first churches had done,
took as binding commands for all time many texts
generally considered mere descriptions of customs of
the first century or instructions suitable to that time.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Thus they &ldquo;saluted one another with a holy kiss&rdquo;
(Romans 16:16); considered private wealth sinful
(Acts 2:44, 45), though they did not actually practice
community of goods; made a weekly collection for the
poor (1 Cor. 16:2); partook of a common meal in connection
with the Lord&rsquo;s Supper (Acts 2:46); and for a
time practiced foot washing (John 13:14). They practiced
close communion even to the extent of excluding
those of their own number who opposed infant baptism.</p>
<p>None of these churches&mdash;Sandemanian, Haldanean
and other&mdash;showed any special interest in Christian
unity. Indeed, there was not much division in Scotland,
where they originated, for almost everybody was
Presbyterian. The restoration of primitive Christianity
was, for them, a movement not toward unity but
away from it. They were little interested in being
united with other Christians, but were anxious to be
<i>right</i>, let who would be wrong. Their insistence upon
conformity to an exact pattern of supposedly primitive
procedure, about which there were sure to be differences
of opinion, tended toward division. This was
doubtless one reason why their success was so small.</p>
<p>Many other small and independent groups of restorers
of primitive Christianity arose in Great Britain
in the eighteenth century and the first years of the
nineteenth. One writer claims to have listed forty,
but the present author has not been able to find so
many. They adopted names of confusing similarity,
either &ldquo;Church of Christ&rdquo; or some name of which
&ldquo;Brethren&rdquo; formed a part. They came and went,
united and divided. Though most of the groups disappeared,
the type persisted. It is now represented
at its best, and with important modifications and additions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
in the British &ldquo;Churches of Christ&rdquo; which are
in communion with the Disciples of Christ in America.</p>
<p>For three hundred years Protestantism had been
based on the idea that the Scriptures were the only
guide, and the restoration of the essential features of
primitive Christianity the only method, for reforming
the church. In the sixteenth century, after freedom
from the Roman hierarchy and from bondage to ecclesiastical
tradition had been won, the effort was
chiefly to restore the pure doctrine of the apostles. In
the seventeenth, attention was given to restoring a
divinely authorized form of church polity, which some
held to be episcopal, others presbyterial, others congregational.
When the major divisions of Protestantism
had crystallized around their respective bodies of
doctrine and systems of polity, the restoration concept
passed out of their minds. It was taken up by smaller
groups of dissenters and irregulars who, in the eighteenth
century, scarcely noticed by the larger bodies,
bent their energies to restoring the ordinances and
worship of the church, as well as its structure, according
to what they conceived to be the original pattern.</p>
<p>When Thomas and Alexander Campbell adopted the
familiar formula of restoration and combined it with
a plea for union, they gave it a different application
and produced a strikingly different result.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="large">THE AMERICAN SCENE</span></h2>
<p>Three things must be noted as characteristic of
America in the period which witnessed the beginnings
of the Disciples of Christ. First, this was a very
young nation. Its population was small. Its frontier,
which began even east of the Allegheny Mountains,
was sparsely settled, but settlers were pouring into it
rapidly. The Disciples began on the frontier and
moved westward with it. Second, the country&rsquo;s religious
forces were divided into five or six large sects
of approximately equal size and many more small ones.
The members of all these together constituted only a
small fraction, perhaps 10 per cent, of the total population.
In no other country was so large a proportion
of the people religiously unattached. Third, America
had a kind and a degree of religious liberty which had
never before existed anywhere in Christendom.
Church and state were separated; the support of the
churches was purely voluntary; no church had legal
advantage or social pre-eminence over others; and
every man had complete liberty to adopt any form
of worship and belief he thought right (or none), to
propagate his faith without hindrance, or to start
a new religious organization if he so desired. This
combination of circumstances had never before
existed. These factors in the environment are immensely
important for our study.</p>
<p>Since the movements which produced the Disciples
of Christ began so near the beginning of the nineteenth
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
century, we may take the year 1800 as a suitable
point at which to make a cross section of the United
States and observe, in a very general way, the state
of the nation.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">America in 1800</span></h3>
<p>George Washington had died the year before. John
Adams was president. The country consisted of sixteen
states, only Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee
having been added to the original thirteen. It had a
population of 5,308,483, less than 10 per cent of whom
lived west of the Alleghenies. (Twenty years later,
in spite of the great westward movement, 73 per cent
of the people were still on the Atlantic slope.) The
population, wealth, industries, and cultural institutions
were very largely concentrated not only east of
the mountains but in the eastern part of the area east
of the mountains. The Atlantic tidewater belt, from
Boston to Charleston, contained the great preponderance
of everything that made this a nation&mdash;except
its land, its undeveloped resources, and its pioneering
spirit. But the eastern cities that loom so large in
history were still small: Philadelphia, 28,522; Boston,
24,037; New York, with 60,515 within the boundaries
of present-day Manhattan, had already taken first
place. In the summer of 1800 the seat of the national
government was moved from Philadelphia to the unfinished
buildings in the almost uninhabited area that
was to become the city of Washington.</p>
<p>The vast region now occupied by the five populous
states west of the Alleghenies and north of the Ohio
River had a grand total of 51,000 inhabitants. It had
been organized as the Northwest Territory under the
Ordinance of 1787, and the Indians had been moved
out of the eastern and southern parts of it in 1795
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
under a treaty forced upon them after Anthony
Wayne&rsquo;s expedition against them. Pittsburgh was a
town of 1,565, the head of navigation on the Ohio.
In 1803 the state of Ohio was carved out of the Northwest
Territory. By 1830 it had a population of more
than 900,000. So urgent was the drive toward the
open frontier and so rapid the development of its communities
that, while trying to realize the newness and
emptiness of the region at a given period, one must be
on guard against failing to realize the rate of change.
Moreover, some parts of the area were much more
advanced than others.</p>
<p>Kentucky was about a generation ahead of the
adjacent Northwest Territory in settlement and culture.
It had a college, the first west of the mountains,
even before it got statehood in 1792. By 1800 it had a
population of 220,000. Lexington, a town of 1,797
(including 439 slaves), its metropolis, the seat of the
college, and the social and economic center of the Bluegrass
Region, could make a plausible claim to the
title, &ldquo;the Athens of the West.&rdquo; The churches came
to Kentucky, as they did everywhere, with the first
wave of settlers. By 1800 the Presbyterians had a
synod and several presbyteries. The most numerous
body was the Baptists, who reported 106 churches with
5,000 members. The Methodists, with perhaps half
that number in the state, organized a Western Conference
the next year, composed of circuits in Kentucky,
Tennessee, and the Northwest Territory. These
were the three vigorous and aggressive churches on
the frontier.</p>
<p>The Mississippi River was the western boundary of
the United States (until 1803), and Florida was still a
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
Spanish possession. Louisiana Territory and Florida
were both held by Roman Catholic powers, and
Protestant churches were not permitted.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">American Churches in 1800</span></h3>
<p>The term, &ldquo;the Church,&rdquo; had little meaning in
America at and after the beginning of the federal
period. There was no <i>Church</i>, either as a visible and
functioning reality or as an ideal; there were only
<i>churches</i>. If we call them &ldquo;sects,&rdquo; it is not to criticize
but simply to describe the fact that the church had
been <i>cut</i> into many parts. In view of the kind of compulsory
unity (or attempted unity) in European and
British Christianity out of which these sects arose,
the divisions were not to their discredit. Sectarianism
was a stage through which Christianity had to pass
on the road to freedom and unity. But the fact of
division is the one now before us.</p>
<p>The largest denominations were the Congregational,
Episcopal, Presbyterian, Baptist, and Methodist.
There were also important bodies of Dutch Reformed,
German Reformed, French Huguenots, Lutherans,
Quakers, and Roman Catholics, and such smaller
groups as the Moravians, Mennonites, Dunkers,
Schwenkfelders, and the Ephrata Society.</p>
<p>The original settlement of the first Atlantic Seaboard
colonies, especially Virginia and New England,
combined the religious with the economic motive. Even
the nationalistic impulse to extend British power was
as much religious as political, for it included zeal for
the extension of Protestantism on a scale to match and
check the Spanish Roman Catholic empire which already
included Florida, the West Indies, Mexico, and
most of South America.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Virginia was Anglican by intention, but from the
start the Puritan element in both the company and the
colony was strong. When the first settlement was
made, and for a good while after, the Puritans were
still a party in the Church of England. Episcopacy
remained established in Virginia until the Revolution,
though there was a strong influx of Scotch-Irish
(Presbyterian, of course) and of Baptists in the
eighteenth century. Since there was no Anglican
bishop in America during all these years, there could
be no confirmations. As always with established
churches, nominal adherents greatly outnumbered
communicants, and many were content with a &ldquo;gentlemanly
conformity.&rdquo; Episcopacy was established also
in North and South Carolina, though it never had
a majority in either colony, and in New York after
the British took it from the Dutch in 1667.</p>
<p>The great Puritan migration to New England had
for its religious purpose the founding of a Puritan
state somewhat on the pattern of Calvin&rsquo;s Geneva.
The developments of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries produced, instead, a group of colonies&mdash;states
in the American union by 1800&mdash;in which Congregationalism
was the &ldquo;standing order,&rdquo; or established
church, and one state, Rhode Island, in which,
thanks to Roger Williams and the Baptists, complete
religious liberty, deliberately adopted as a matter of
conviction, got its first fair trial as a principle of government.
But Congregationalism, though clinging to
some of its legal advantages, had also grown tolerant,
partly because dissenters and noncommunicants had
become so very numerous. As early as 1760, the president
of Yale estimated that 12 per cent in the four New
England colonies were dissenters, and that not more
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
than one-fifth of the others were communicant members
of Congregational churches.</p>
<p>New England Congregationalism, though already
disturbed by the theological controversy which later
produced the Unitarian defection, was in the main
soundly Calvinistic. It differed from Presbyterianism
only in its tradition of the independence of the local
church, and even this was qualified by the growth of
what was called &ldquo;associationism&rdquo; by those who
viewed it with alarm. So, when an interest in home
missions began to appear, about 1800, the Plan of
Union was formed under which Congregationalists and
Presbyterians cooperated until 1837 in carrying the
gospel to the new settlements, first in western New
York and then in the regions beyond. The Presbyterians
ultimately got most of the churches organized
in the Middle West by Congregational missionaries
operating under this plan.</p>
<p>Presbyterians came from England, Scotland, and
North Ireland. They never had a colony of their
own, though they missed having Massachusetts Bay
only because the Presbyterian Puritans who founded
it became Congregational. Puritans who came to
other colonies generally were and remained Presbyterians.
They found a footing in New York, New
Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, and
Georgia and were among the first settlers of Kentucky.
Pennsylvania became the scene of some of their most
vigorous activities, both in and around Philadelphia
and in the central and western part, where they were
the most numerous and influential group. William
Tennent&rsquo;s &ldquo;Log College&rdquo; at Neshaminy (1720)
initiated theological education in America, at least
outside of Harvard&rsquo;s effort to provide a learned clergy
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
for New England. It trained evangelists as well as
scholars, and led to the founding of Princeton. The
great Scotch-Irish immigration, about the middle of
the eighteenth century, brought both regular Presbyterians,
in communion with the Church of Scotland,
and Seceder Presbyterians, representing the Great
Secession of 1733. Large numbers of both came to
the western parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia, where
these Presbyterian Ulstermen &ldquo;formed an American
Ulster larger and richer than that they had abandoned,&rdquo;
as one of them wrote, with some exaggeration
of the degree of their occupancy though not of the size
and resources of the area. Thomas Campbell was
following a stream of Scotch-Irish Seceder Presbyterians
when he migrated from the vicinity of Belfast,
Ireland, to the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Baptist beginnings in America are easily localized in
Rhode Island, but their dispersal and multiplication
cannot be simply diagramed. They went everywhere,
on their individual initiative, with no general organization,
were persecuted wherever intolerance ruled,
and generally despised by their more conventional and
respectable neighbors, chiefly because they insisted
that religion was a purely voluntary matter, that
Christian, Turk, Jew, or atheist should be allowed to
follow his own convictions about faith and worship,
and that the state had nothing to do with it. That
position seemed almost equivalent to anarchy. The
fact that most of the Baptist preachers were ignorant
men, or self-taught and uncouth, and that a great
many of them were farmers six days in the week and
preachers only on Sunday, made the matter worse.
But the Baptists did have a college, founded in 1764,
which became Brown University. In cities and towns
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
their preachers became more urbane, but they kept the
aggressiveness and the popular appeal which brought
immense success to their cause in the Middle West and
in the South. Regular Baptists were Calvinistic.
Their Philadelphia Confession, which was very similar
in doctrine to the Presbyterians&rsquo; Westminster Confession,
was commonly used as a standard of orthodoxy.
It taught that Christ died only for the elect.
But there were also &ldquo;General Baptists,&rdquo; who believed
in a general atonement, or that Christ died for all.
The difference between the two became significant.</p>
<p>Methodism in America began when two or three lay
preachers came in the 1760&rsquo;s, and when John Wesley
sent two preachers from England in 1769. But the revival
of 1740, known as the Great Awakening, had prepared
the way for it. Through the Revolution and until
1784, Methodism remained nominally a movement in
the Anglican Church, but it had its societies,
preachers, classes, and circuits, and its evangelists converted
thousands of the religiously indifferent. Formal
organization began with the Christmas conference,
1784. The Methodist system of supervision by &ldquo;superintendents,&rdquo;
who promptly became bishops, and by
presiding elders, with preachers riding circuits and
class leaders conserving local gains, constituted a
planned economy in the business of serving the religious
needs of the frontier. But without tireless
energy and zealous devotion, all this machinery could
not have been effective. Methodism began on the
Atlantic Seaboard and it had good success there, but
the scene of its most spectacular growth was in the
West and South. By 1800 the Methodists, Baptists,
and Presbyterians had become the great &ldquo;popular
churches&rdquo; on the frontier; and the frontier itself was
on the verge of a startlingly rapid transformation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>It must not be supposed that the attitudes of the
denominations toward each other were altogether
those of mutual hostility and competition, or even of
isolation. There was much of this, but there was also
much of mutual respect and friendliness. From 1800
to about 1837 there was a noticeable increase of cooperation
among the members of many denominations.
This is seen in the earliest phases of Sunday school
work, in Bible publication and distribution, in certain
aspects of foreign and home missionary activity, and
in the antislavery and temperance societies. But the
most conspicuous feature of American Christianity
continued to be its divided state.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Land of the Free</span></h3>
<p>One reason for this sectarian condition was that
this was a free country. Under the First Amendment
to the Constitution, which is the first article of
the Bill of Rights, no church could ever receive special
favors from the government nor could there be discrimination
against any. When the American Government
adopted this hands-off policy, leaving the whole
matter of religion to the churches and to the people,
the old compulsory unity disappeared&mdash;even the ghost
of unity which England had, with its one national
church and a number of &ldquo;dissenting&rdquo; bodies still
under certain legal handicaps.</p>
<p>It is little wonder that America had many churches.
Colonists had come from many countries bringing all
the varieties of religion that existed in all those countries.
Many of them had come as refugees from
persecution. In later years, some divisions occurred
on American soil, but the sects that were here in 1800
had all been imported from Europe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Moreover, since the United States was formed by the
union of thirteen colonies, the new nation, of course,
had as many different churches as all the colonies together
had had. In some colonies, especially Rhode
Island, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, there had been
a considerable variety of churches enjoying equal
liberty. In others the situation was much as it was in
England at the same time, with their established
churches and with dissenting bodies existing as best
they could under the shadow of the favored church.
The founders and builders of the American colonies,
with a few exceptions, had not believed in the separation
of church and state or in equal liberty for all religious
groups. But the idea of religious liberty had
been growing, and the multiplicity of churches in the
new nation made the establishment of any one of them
as <i>the</i> national church a practical impossibility. No
one even suggested it in the Constitutional Convention
of 1787.</p>
<p>It is hard for us now to realize how continuous and
almost universal had been the belief that the welfare
of the state was bound up with religious uniformity.
For more than a thousand years, and throughout
Christendom, practically everybody except little bands
of heretics and rebels believed that the institutional
unity of the church was essential to the security of
the state and the stability of the social order, and that
it was the state&rsquo;s duty to enforce this unity. That belief
furnished the reason&mdash;and when not the reason,
the excuse&mdash;for most of the persecutions that have occurred.
Roman Catholics, of course, believed it, and
it is still the official teaching of the Roman Catholic
Church. But most Protestants also believed it. Only
the Baptists and Quakers and some small separatist
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
sects in Germany believed in religious liberty as a
matter of principle. But the established and respectable
bodies considered these as wild-eyed radicals.</p>
<p>Episcopalians and Puritans who founded colonies
in America brought with them this idea of a state
church and a religious unity enforced by the police
power, not because they were bigoted or cruel by
preference but because they believed, as almost everybody
had believed for centuries, that in no other way
could a political society be strong enough to survive.
Surprise is sometimes expressed at the &ldquo;inconsistency&rdquo;
of the Puritans, who &ldquo;came seeking religious
liberty&rdquo; and then persecuted the Quakers and Baptists.
But there is no inconsistency, for they did not
come seeking religious liberty. They came to establish
a Puritan state. They had to learn religious
liberty after they arrived, and they were rather slow
in learning it. But even the vestiges of the colonial
religious establishments withered away after the
Revolution, and America became, in fact as well as in
constitutional theory, a nation in which all churches,
like all individuals, are free and equal before the law.</p>
<p>A new epoch in the history of religion began when a
nation was born which (<i>a</i>) disclaimed for its civil
power the right and duty of giving special protection
to a favored church, (<i>b</i>) declared implicitly, as the
Virginia Bill of Rights in 1776 had done explicitly,
that religion must be purely voluntary, and (<i>c</i>) abandoned
the medieval political philosophy which justified
intolerance on the theory that the state must enforce
religious uniformity in the interest of its own stability
and security.</p>
<p>These new American conditions had, among others,
three results that are of vital importance in connection
with the present study:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>First, the removal of the repressive hand of government
made it easier for new religious movements to
spring up or for old ones to divide. Hence new divisions
in the church arose in addition to those which
had been imported from Europe. The divided state of
the Christian forces became more acute and called
more urgently for correction.</p>
<p>Second, the problem of Christian union ceased to be
in any sense a political problem and became a purely
religious problem to be solved by religious means.
Seventeenth century advocates of union had, to be sure,
preached brotherly love and made some statements
about uniting on the simple essentials of Christianity;
but they had sought support largely from political
leaders, trying to show them how a national church,
united by making concessions to bring back the dissenters,
would increase the nation&rsquo;s strength, or how
an alliance between the churches of different countries
would be a good stroke of diplomacy. The conceptions
of complete religious liberty for the individual and of
free churches in a free state introduced an entirely new
approach to the question of union. Those conceptions
had to be thoroughly worked out before the problem of
Christian union in the modern sense&mdash;which is also the
primitive sense&mdash;could even be stated; and they had to
be made operative in government before a solution
could be hopefully attempted. There had to be complete
freedom to divide before there could be a union
that would not deny freedom.</p>
<p>Third, separation of church and state and recognition
of the voluntary character of religion threw directly
upon the members of churches the whole
responsibility for supporting the churches and promoting
their work by voluntary contributions. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Christian discovery and conquest of America was to
be organized and financed on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>Such, in bare outline, was the American scene in
which the forerunners and fathers of the Disciples of
Christ, about the beginning of the nineteenth century,
began to advocate a simple and noncreedal Christianity,
the union of all Christians on the basis of the
essential and primitive conditions of discipleship, and
the restoration of such features of the &ldquo;ancient order
of things&rdquo; as might be agreed upon as designed to be
permanent practices of the church.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="large">THE &ldquo;CHRISTIANS&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The longest direct tributary to the stream which
became the Disciples of Christ is the movement
with which the name of Barton W. Stone is generally
associated. This took visible form when he and his
four colleagues dissolved the Springfield Presbytery,
in 1804, and took the name &ldquo;Christians.&rdquo; Back of
this, however, lay two other movements which led to
the formation of &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; churches. Stone was
certainly fully informed about the first of these before
taking his own step, but probably not about the
second. The three were so nearly identical in principles
and objectives that they considered themselves
as constituting a single body as soon as they learned of
one another&rsquo;s work and long before they had any
organizational unity. We shall consider the three
parts of the &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; Church in the order of their
origin. The first was a secession from the Methodists,
the second from the Baptists, the third from the
Presbyterians.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">In Virginia and North Carolina, 1794</span></h3>
<p>Methodism was not a denomination but only a revival
movement in the Church of England until the
end of the Revolutionary War. In 1771, John Wesley
sent Francis Asbury from England. He became the
most important factor in winning converts, enlisting
workers, setting up the system of circuits and itinerant
preachers, and organizing the church. By 1784, about
15,000 members were enrolled in Methodist societies
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
in Virginia and the adjacent states. But these societies
were not churches. They had no ordained ministers
and therefore could not have the sacraments.
Asbury himself was still a lay preacher. The Virginia
Methodist preachers voted to break away from the
Anglican Church, but Asbury, backed by Wesley, resisted.
The end of the war and the independence of
the American colonies changed the situation. Wesley
sent over, by the hand of Dr. Coke, a letter which has
become a famous document. Part of it has been quoted
in another connection. In conclusion Wesley wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As our American brethren are now totally disentangled
from the state and from the English
hierarchy, we dare not entangle them again either
with the one or the other. They are now at full
liberty simply to follow the Scriptures and the
primitive church. And we judge it best that they
should stand fast in that liberty with which God
has so strangely made them free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(It seemed strange to Wesley that God should wish
the American colonies to be free from Great Britain,
an outcome to which he himself had been bitterly opposed.)</p>
<p>Wesley&rsquo;s letter was read to a conference which met
on Christmas Eve, 1784, at Baltimore. The conference
declared the independence of Methodism, adopted
the name &ldquo;The Methodist Episcopal Church,&rdquo; and
ordained Asbury as deacon, elder, and superintendent.
James O&rsquo;Kelly and twelve others were ordained as
elders. Simultaneously with counseling the American
brethren to follow the primitive church and stand
fast in their liberty, Wesley had appointed Asbury
and Coke to be &ldquo;superintendents&rdquo; of American
Methodism. Coke soon returned to England, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
Asbury changed his own title to that of &ldquo;bishop&rdquo; and
assumed such powers as no Anglican bishop or
Methodist superintendent in England ever had. For
one thing, Asbury assigned every preacher to his field,
every presiding elder to his district, and from his assignments
there was no appeal.</p>
<p>James O&rsquo;Kelly had become a Methodist lay preacher
in 1775, when he was about forty years old. He had
been one of &ldquo;Asbury&rsquo;s Ironsides,&rdquo; and had been the
leader of those who urged an earlier separation from
the Anglican Church. He had also led the futile protest
against Asbury&rsquo;s assumption of the title of
&ldquo;bishop.&rdquo; Asbury had made him a presiding elder,
but he continued to be the head and front of the resistance
to the bishop&rsquo;s autocracy. When a demand
for the &ldquo;right of appeal&rdquo; was voted down by a general
conference in 1792, O&rsquo;Kelly and a number of other
preachers withdrew. A year later they organized the
&ldquo;Republican Methodist Church,&rdquo; with about thirty
ministers and 1,000 members. This stage of the independent
movement lasted only seven months.</p>
<p>On August 4, 1794, the Republican Methodists met in
conference at Old Lebanon Church, in Surry County,
Virginia, and adopted as their name &ldquo;The Christian
Church.&rdquo; This name was suggested by Rice Haggard,
formerly a Methodist lay preacher and one of
O&rsquo;Kelly&rsquo;s partners in protest from the beginning. The
members of the conference resolved, further, to take
the Bible as their only creed. They had discovered, as
one of them put it, that &ldquo;the primitive church government,
which came down from heaven, was a republic,
though &lsquo;Christian Church&rsquo; is its name.&rdquo; All preachers
were to be on an equal footing. Ministers and laymen
were to have liberty of private judgment. Conferences
were to be merely advisory, and each congregation
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
should &ldquo;call its own pastor and enjoy the greatest
possible freedom.&rdquo; It is to be noted that this secession
from the Methodist Church involved no dissent
from Methodist doctrine. It grew solely out of dissatisfaction
with that church&rsquo;s system of government.
The type of religious thought and preaching in the
separated group remained substantially Methodist.</p>
<p>The new movement started with a staff of experienced
and zealous ministers, under whose influence a
considerable number of Methodist churches now became
&ldquo;Christian.&rdquo; The Methodist Church in Virginia
and North Carolina suffered a net loss of 3,670, in
spite of its vigorous evangelism, during the first year
of the &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; church. Fifteen years later it was
estimated that the Christian Church had 20,000 members
&ldquo;in the southern and western states.&rdquo; This
doubtless includes Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">In New England, 1801</span></h3>
<p>The first &ldquo;Christian Church&rdquo; in New England was
about seven years later than the first in the South,
and its origin was entirely unrelated to the earlier
one. The New England movement got its impulse
from the independent reactions of two young men
against the type of religion they found in the Baptist
churches of which they were members and in which
they began to preach. These churches were Calvinistic
in their emphasis on original sin, the limitation of the
benefits of Christ&rsquo;s atonement to the &ldquo;elect,&rdquo; the
wrath of God toward sinners, the threat of hell, and
the inability of man to do anything for his own salvation.</p>
<p>Elias Smith, born in 1769 at Lyme, Connecticut,
spent his boyhood under very crude frontier conditions
in a new settlement in Vermont, and had a violent
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
experience of conversion when a log fell on him in
the woods. He joined the Baptist church, and began
to preach when he was about twenty-one. In spite
of his almost complete lack of education, the Baptist
ministers of Boston ordained him two years later. For
almost a decade he was a somewhat irregular Baptist
preacher, improving his education by diligent private
study, becoming more and more dissatisfied with
orthodox Calvinism, seeking a way out of his confusion
by independent study of the New Testament,
and moving toward the conviction that the churches
should abandon their theological and ecclesiastical
systems and restore the simple faith and practice of the
primitive church.</p>
<p>Abner Jones, born in 1772 at Royalton, Massachusetts,
had a Vermont boyhood not unlike Smith&rsquo;s in
its combination of frontier hardship, lack of schools,
and torturing religious experience. Having achieved
conversion, he joined the Baptist church, taught
school for a time, then studied and practiced medicine
by the short-cut &ldquo;Thompsonian&rdquo; system; but he also
preached as opportunity offered. Still in his early
twenties, he &ldquo;quit the fellowship of the Calvinist Baptists,&rdquo;
as his biographer testifies, after hearing Elias
Smith preach, though Smith was then still a Baptist.
As the result of his own thinking, stirred by Smith&rsquo;s
influence, Jones organized an independent church at
Lyndon, Vermont, in the Autumn of 1801, to which
he would give no name but &ldquo;Christian.&rdquo; This, says
the historian of the movement, was &ldquo;the first Christian
church in New England.&rdquo; During the next year Jones
secured ordination by three Free Will Baptist
preachers&mdash;not as a Baptist but &ldquo;only as a Christian&rdquo;&mdash;and
organized &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; churches at Hanover and
Piermont, New Hampshire. Up to this time, Smith
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
had been the leader in thought but had hesitated to
break his Baptist ties. Jones now persuaded him to
abandon the Baptist name and joined him in organizing
a &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; church at Portsmouth, New
Hampshire. In 1804 Jones moved to Boston and
formed a church there.</p>
<p>These two men, Smith and Jones, lived and worked
for nearly forty years after that. Jones established
churches at Salem, Massachusetts, where he lived for
several years, and at many other towns in New England,
never striking root very deeply in any place but
winning many followers to the movement and a number
of preachers to its advocacy. Smith&rsquo;s most important
contribution was the founding of a religious
paper, the <i>Herald of Gospel Liberty</i>, the first issue of
which was published on September 1, 1808, at Portsmouth,
New Hampshire. With some slight intermissions
and under a variety of names, finally returning
to the original one, this journal was published for 122
years and then merged with the <i>Congregationalist</i>.</p>
<p>Within twenty years after the founding of that first
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo; church at Lyndon, Vermont, there were
dozens of such churches in New England and others in
adjacent parts of Canada and in New York and Pennsylvania,
all deriving from this original impulse.
These were, on principle, independent churches. No
organization directed or controlled them and they had
no cooperative activities. However, there was a sense
of fellowship among them and they soon began to hold
informal conferences. There is record of a meeting
of &ldquo;the elders of the Christian Churches in the New
England states, assembled at Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
June 23, 1809,&rdquo; which authorized a fraternal
reply to a letter from representatives of the Christian
Churches in Virginia and North Carolina. The &ldquo;general
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
conference&rdquo; held at Windham, Connecticut, in
1816, and the series of &ldquo;United States conferences&rdquo;
beginning in 1820 were really, in spite of their comprehensive
names, only conferences of the churches in the
northeastern states. One of these, in 1827, voted that
it was not proper for ministers to use the title
&ldquo;Reverend&rdquo; and passed a resolution condemning the
use of instrumental music in public worship. About
thirty regional conferences, by states or parts of
states, had been organized within this area before
1832.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">In Kentucky, 1804</span></h3>
<p>Third in order of time, but first in importance in
relation to the Disciples, among the three movements
which together constituted the &ldquo;Christian Church&rdquo;
was the one in which Stone emerged as the leading
figure.</p>
<p>Barton W. Stone, born in 1772 at Port Tobacco,
Maryland, was a member of one of the oldest American
families. His great-great-great-grandfather was the
first Protestant governor of Maryland, 1648-53. Barton
Stone&rsquo;s father, a man of some property, died just
before the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, and his
mother moved with her large family to Pittsylvania
County, Virginia, very close to the North Carolina
line. With his share of the money from his father&rsquo;s
estate, Barton spent three years in David Caldwell&rsquo;s
academy at Greensboro, North Carolina, thirty miles
southwest of his home. Here he &ldquo;completed the classical
course&rdquo; in 1793. This school was hospitable to
revivalism. Caldwell himself was a Princeton graduate
and a Presbyterian minister of the &ldquo;New Light&rdquo;
type&mdash;that is, of evangelistic temper and with an easy
tolerance in theology. McGready, the Presbyterian
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
evangelist who was later to set southern Kentucky
afire, came to Greensboro and converted most of the
students. Stone was stirred by the appeal but repelled
by the theology. Meanwhile his mother, who
had been an Anglican, had become a Methodist. William
Hodge, a young &ldquo;New Light&rdquo; Presbyterian, who
had been one of Caldwell&rsquo;s boys, came preaching the
love rather than the wrath of God. Stone abandoned
his purpose to study law and decided to be that kind
of Presbyterian preacher. The presbytery to which he
applied for license directed him to prepare a trial sermon
on the Trinity. He struggled with the theme, and
his sermon was accepted, but he always had trouble
with the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
<p>While waiting for his license to preach, he went to
Georgia to visit his brother and while there he served
for about a year, beginning in January, 1795, as &ldquo;professor
of languages&rdquo; in Succoth Academy, a Methodist
school at Washington, Georgia. The principal of this
academy was Hope Hull, a Methodist preacher who
had been closely associated with O&rsquo;Kelly in his protest
at the Methodist conference two years earlier but who
had remained with the Methodist Church when
O&rsquo;Kelly and the other insurgents withdrew to form the
Christian Church. Stone and Hull became very intimate
friends, and Stone accompanied Hull on a journey
to Charleston, South Carolina, to attend a Methodist
conference. John Springer, an ardently evangelistic
Presbyterian preacher of the &ldquo;New Light&rdquo;
type, whose field was only a few miles from the
academy and who had the most cordial relations with
the Baptists and Methodists in his neighborhood, became
another counselor and friend and exercised, says
Ware, a &ldquo;decisive influence&rdquo; on Stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Returning to North Carolina, Stone received his
license to preach from the hands of the venerable and
liberal Henry Pattillo, who, in a published sermon on
&ldquo;Divisions among Christians,&rdquo; had recommended the
name &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; as the one &ldquo;first given to the disciples
by divine appointment at Antioch,&rdquo; and who
declared that men ought to be permitted to differ
peaceably about the doctrines of religion.</p>
<p>To summarize the influences of Stone&rsquo;s early background
and environment, these items may be listed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The Great Awakening, which, under the preaching
of men trained in William Tennent&rsquo;s Log College
and of George Whitefield, beginning about 1740 but
echoing through the middle and southern colonies for
more than half a century after that in the work of
Samuel Davies and many other evangelistic or &ldquo;New
Light&rdquo; Presbyterians, had stressed the common elements
of the gospel and put the divisive doctrines of
the creeds into a subordinate place.</p>
<p>2. The Methodist movement, which did not cease
to be a revival when it became a church and which
challenged the Calvinism of the Presbyterian creed.</p>
<p>3. The &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; Church, which was having its
first rapid growth in Virginia and North Carolina
while Stone was in the first formative stage of his
ministry in the same region.</p>
<p>4. The direct and personal influence of the men who
have been mentioned in the preceding paragraphs:
David Caldwell, James McGready, William Hodge,
Hope Hull, John Springer, and Henry Pattillo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After an experimental and not very successful missionary
trip which took him through the eastern part
of North Carolina and back through Virginia, and
feeling that there was a better field on the frontier,
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
Stone headed west, on horseback again. Within three
months he had ridden to Knoxville and, at some peril
from Indians, on to Nashville (population 346 by the
next census); had associated for a time with Thomas
Craighead, a Princeton-trained Presbyterian preacher
of independent mind, famous for his zeal for a
&ldquo;rational and scriptural evangelism&rdquo; and his scant
respect for the authority of creed and presbytery; had
itinerated and preached in the Cumberland district of
Tennessee; and had then crossed Cumberland Gap into
Kentucky, spent a little time at Danville and Lexington,
and by October, 1796, was installed as regular
supply pastor of two Presbyterian churches at Cane
Ridge and Concord. Cane Ridge was seven miles east
of Paris; Concord, ten miles northeast of Cane Ridge.</p>
<p>The next year a call to the settled pastorate of his
churches made it necessary for Stone to seek ordination
from the Transylvania Presbytery. This would
require a declaration of his adherence to the Westminster
Confession. Renewed study did not resolve
his doubts about the Trinity. Before facing the
presbytery, he privately stated his trouble to James
Blythe, then probably the most influential Presbyterian
in Kentucky and later one of the severest critics
of Stone&rsquo;s views. In the public ceremony, Stone declared
his acceptance of the Confession &ldquo;as far as I see
it consistent with the Word of God.&rdquo; Upon that
guarded statement he was ordained.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Cane Ridge Meeting</span></h3>
<p>The Great Western Revival, with which the names
of Stone and Cane Ridge are closely associated, resulted
from transplanting to Tennessee and Kentucky
the methods of evangelistic appeal which had been
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
used by &ldquo;New Light&rdquo; Presbyterians, Methodists, and
&ldquo;Christians&rdquo; in the Southern states east of the mountains.
Under frontier conditions it developed some
bizarre and sensational features which have drawn
attention away from its real values. It began gradually
with the preaching of four or five men&mdash;especially
James McGready and the brothers William and
John McGee&mdash;who had come west about the time Stone
came, and who itinerated in Tennessee, near and north
of Nashville, and the adjacent part of Kentucky. For
three or four years the revival spirit grew and spread
until the countryside was in a fever of excitement.
Fantastic manifestations began to appear among persons
who experienced &ldquo;conviction of sin,&rdquo; and even
among those who came to scoff&mdash;jerking and barking,
hysterical laughter, falling and lying rigid like dead
men. These were taken for manifestations of the
power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Stone, who was concerned about religious apathy in
his own parishes, traveled the nearly two hundred
miles from Cane Ridge to Logan County in southwestern
Kentucky, in the early spring of 1801, to see
the revival in progress under the preaching of McGready.
He was impressed with the genuineness of
the revival. The physical demonstrations seemed to
be &ldquo;the work of God,&rdquo; but inexplicable and not wholly
desirable. Stone was, in a sense, the advance agent of
the revival as it moved north and east through Kentucky.
By late spring it had reached the Bluegrass.
On the Sundays of May and June, there were great
meetings at churches in the area around Lexington,
with attendance at the last three running to 4,000,
then 8,000, then 10,000, according to contemporary
estimates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The climax came in the Cane Ridge camp meeting,
which lasted from Friday to Wednesday, August 7-12,
1801. The crowd was estimated at 20,000. Many
Presbyterian, several Methodist, and a few Baptist
ministers preached, often simultaneously at different
stations through the woods. The excitement was
intense. The fantastic &ldquo;exercises&rdquo; occurred in great
profusion. This meeting was held at Stone&rsquo;s church,
and he had much to do with bringing it about, but it
was not in any sense his meeting. It does not appear
that he was the most prominent among the preachers.
Richard McNemar, for example, was more conspicuous,
and so was McNemar&rsquo;s nine-year-old daughter, who
became a child prophetess and poured forth a torrent
of exhortation from a perch on his shoulder. Stone
rejoiced in the awakened interest in religion and in the
salvation of many sinners, but the records do not
show that he gave encouragement to the spectacular
&ldquo;exercises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not all the Presbyterians approved of this violent
revivalism. Three features especially offended them:
the opportunity it gave to preachers lacking education;
the wild and disorderly physical &ldquo;exercises&rdquo;;
and the stress upon the idea that &ldquo;Christ died for
all,&rdquo; not for a limited number, the elect. The issue
about education was especially acute in southern Kentucky
and became one of the grounds for the &ldquo;Cumberland
secession&rdquo; and the formation of the Cumberland
Presbyterian Church. The &ldquo;exercises&rdquo; gradually
ceased to be a prominent feature of revivalism, except
in remote and retarded communities, and left no
permanent mark on any major group. While they
lasted they prepared the way for an invasion by the
Shakers, who won some temporary following. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
declaration that Christ died for all raised a real
theological issue. This was what the Methodists were
preaching. So also were the &ldquo;General&rdquo; Baptists, who
were distinguished from the &ldquo;Particular&rdquo; Baptists
by their belief in a general atonement. Both kinds of
Baptists were numerous in Kentucky, and the &ldquo;Generals&rdquo;
later became a fertile field for the Reformers.
Within two or three years after Cane Ridge the main
wave had passed, but the camp meeting remained as a
popular pattern of religious and social life, though
without the more extreme features which had made the
&ldquo;great revival&rdquo; spectacular.</p>
<p>Richard McNemar, a Presbyterian minister, had not
only been a prominent figure at the Cane Ridge meeting
but had elsewhere cooperated with the Methodists,
whose type of evangelistic appeal was congenial to
him. Three months after the meeting a heresy charge
against McNemar was presented to his presbytery.
The process was delayed because so many of the &ldquo;revival
men&rdquo; took his part that those who had filed the
charge hesitated to bring it to a vote. After various
procedures in the presbytery, all irregular and indecisive,
and after another minister, John Thompson, had
become involved in the case, the Synod of Kentucky,
meeting at Lexington, September 6-13, 1803, formally
censured the presbytery for letting these two men
continue to preach while the charge of holding
&ldquo;Arminian tenets&rdquo; (i.e., Methodist doctrines) was
pending against them.</p>
<p>As the synod was preparing to put McNemar and
Thompson on trial, they presented to the synod a
document signed by themselves and three others, protesting
against the trial and withdrawing from the
synod&rsquo;s jurisdiction. The other three were Barton W.
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
Stone, John Dunlavy, and Robert Marshall. After a
futile effort to win them back, the synod placed the
five under suspension.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">The Springfield Presbytery</span></h3>
<p>These five men had left the Synod of Kentucky, not
the Presbyterian Church. Their first act was to organize
the Springfield Presbytery, independent of the
synod. (Their &ldquo;Springfield&rdquo; is now Springdale, ten
miles north of Cincinnati.) Their second act was to
issue a statement of their position. This is a pamphlet
of about 100 pages, the full title of which is: <i>An Abstract
of an Apology for Renouncing the Jurisdiction
of the Synod of Kentucky, Being a Compendious View
of the Gospel and a few Remarks on the Confession
of Faith</i>, with the names of the five attached as authors.
The important points in this statement are:
(1) Christ died for all&mdash;as against a limited atonement
for the elect only. (2) The gospel itself is the means
of regeneration, and faith is the act by which any man,
if he will, can lay hold on that means. (3) Faith is
the natural man&rsquo;s belief of testimony&mdash;a rational, as
against a mystical, conception of faith. Nothing is
said explicitly about either Christian union or the
restoration of primitive Christianity. (William
Guirey, a Virginia Christian minister, later sent a
copy of this <i>Apology</i> to the New England Christians
as expressing the sentiments of the Virginia-North
Carolina group, and said that the Kentucky five
&ldquo;united with us&rdquo; when they left the Presbyterians.)</p>
<p>So far, this was an anti-Calvinist movement within
the Presbyterian Church. Its leaders admitted that
their position was not in agreement with the Westminster
Confession, but claimed the right to differ
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
from the Confession where they thought it differed
from the Scriptures. The whole history of &ldquo;New
Light&rdquo; Presbyterianism in Virginia and the states
south of it from colonial days, as well as the recent
revival in Kentucky, gave them ground for saying:
&ldquo;We are not the only Presbyterians who view the
doctrine of the atonement different from the Confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Springfield Presbytery was only a transition
stage. These five men might make their independent
presbytery the nucleus of a new Presbyterian body, as
the Seceders and others had done in Scotland long before,
and as the Cumberland Presbyterians were to
do a little later; or they might cease to be Presbyterians.
They chose the latter course. On June 28,
1804, less than a year after its organization, the
Springfield Presbytery met at Cane Ridge and decreed
its own dissolution. The document in which it
recorded this action is called &ldquo;The Last Will and
Testament of the Springfield Presbytery.&rdquo; By this instrument,
the presbytery willed &ldquo;that this body die,
be dissolved and sink into union with the Body of
Christ at large,&rdquo; that every congregation should be
independent in the choice and support of its minister
and the discipline of its members, and that the Bible
alone should be their guide and standard. Ministers
are not to be called &ldquo;Reverend,&rdquo; are to &ldquo;obtain
license from God to preach the simple Gospel,&rdquo; and
are to be supported by free-will offerings &ldquo;without a
written call or subscription.&rdquo; And finally, the Synod
of Kentucky is exhorted to examine every suspect and
suspend every heretic, &ldquo;that the oppressed may go
free and taste the sweets of gospel liberty.&rdquo; (The full
text of the &ldquo;Last Will and Testament&rdquo; was reprinted
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
in the first issue of Elias Smith&rsquo;s <i>Herald of Gospel
Liberty</i>, Portsmouth, N. H., Sept. 1, 1808.)</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">The Christian Church</span></h3>
<p>At this same meeting, June 28, 1804, it was agreed
that the name &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; should be adopted, to the
exclusion of all sectarian names. This was suggested
by Rice Haggard, who had made the same suggestion
to the O&rsquo;Kelly group ten years earlier when the Republican
Methodists were looking for a new name.
Haggard had been active as a minister of the Christian
Church in North Carolina and Virginia from 1794
until his removal to Kentucky about the time of the
Cane Ridge meeting.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; of Kentucky immediately became
a group of churches as well as a group of preachers.
Fervid evangelists as they were, the ministers immediately
won to the movement several of the Presbyterian
churches for which they had preached and organized
some new ones. By the end of 1804 there were
at least thirteen Christian churches in north-central
Kentucky and about seven more in southwestern Ohio.
Presbyterians called it the &ldquo;New Light schism.&rdquo; The
number of preachers was increased by the adherence
of a few revival Presbyterians, by the coming of some
Christians from the East, and by recognizing as
preachers a good many men who had little or no
formal education.</p>
<p>Shaker missionaries came to Kentucky in 1805, attracted
by reports of the marvelous manifestations of
the Spirit in the great revival. McNemar and Dunlavy
soon joined them.</p>
<p>In the new Christian Church, no question was at first
raised about baptism. Within a few years, Stone
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
came to the belief that only the immersion of believers
was scriptural baptism, and this view spread
gradually through the group. Stone immersed many,
including some preachers, before he was himself immersed.
But it was not made a test of fellowship.
Twenty years later Stone wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was unanimously agreed that every brother
and sister should act according to their faith;
that we should not judge one another for being
baptized or for not being baptized in this mode.
The far greater part of the church submitted to
be baptized by immersion, and now [1827] there
is not one in 500 among us who has not been immersed.
From the commencement we have
avoided controversy on this subject. (<i>Christian
Messenger</i>, Vol. I, p. 267, Oct., 1827.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This trend toward immersion existed only in the
West. In the East it became a divisive issue in 1809,
and only a minority adopted it. Immersion never became
the common practice with the New England
Christians.</p>
<p>For some time there was no organization among the
Christian churches. A &ldquo;general meeting&rdquo; of the ministers
was held at Bethel, Kentucky, August 8, 1810,
at which they &ldquo;agreed to unite themselves formally.&rdquo;
This suggested to some the need of a clearer definition
of doctrines, especially those of the Trinity, Christ,
and the atonement. After statements had been drafted
and discussed at a later meeting, it was agreed by
almost all that freedom of theological opinion was
better than conformity to a standard. Marshall and
Thompson, feeling that the creedless Christians were
too loose in doctrine, returned to the Presbyterian
Church. This left only Stone, of the original five who
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
had seceded from the synod on account of the heresy
charges against McNemar and Thompson. So it was
by survival, rather than by pre-eminence at the beginning,
that Stone came to be considered the founding
father of the Christian Church in Kentucky. Later,
especially after he began the publication of the <i>Christian
Messenger</i> in 1826, his leadership is evident; and
in guiding the greater part of the Christian Church in
the West into the merger with the Disciples, his influence
was probably decisive.</p>
<p>The growth of the western Christian Church was
not confined to Kentucky. It took root immediately
in Tennessee and in southern Ohio and Indiana.
Traveling evangelists went also into the South. As
the tide of migration moved to new frontiers, unordained
elders, farmer-preachers, and sometimes
regular ministers carried it to Illinois, Missouri, and
Iowa. The position of Kentucky, as a breeding ground
of pioneers who went out in steady streams to aid
in laying the foundations of these states, made it a
strategic point from which a new religious movement
might make its influence felt throughout the Middle
West.</p>
<p>Such was the emphasis upon the independence of
local churches and of preachers, and so firm the determination
to avoid anything like the Presbyterian
or Methodist systems of centralized control, that organization
was slow and weak. That meeting in 1810,
at which it was agreed to &ldquo;unite formally,&rdquo; did not
in fact lead to any formal organization. District conferences
were arranged. There was a Deer Creek
(Ohio) Conference as early as 1808, and in the following
years there were many such. But as late as
1826, Stone felt it necessary to defend the practice
of holding even district conferences for worship, to exchange
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
news of the churches, to arrange appointments
so as to supply destitute churches, and (a tentative
suggestion) &ldquo;for ordination, if thought proper,&rdquo; but
emphatically with no authority over local churches.
In the same year the Wabash (Indiana) Conference
agreed that it would be well &ldquo;to have a general conference
established in some convenient place in the
western states,&rdquo; but this was not done. The Christian
Church in the West had nothing corresponding to what
is now called &ldquo;cooperative work,&rdquo; and no agencies or
structures through which such work could be carried
on. The churches of the Northeast had their so-called
United States Conference, but sometimes they
had qualms about so much ecclesiasticism. The (New
England) general conference of 1832 voted to dissolve
forever, but revived the next year.</p>
<p>Though there was no inclusive organization, the
three main divisions of the Christian Church had some
acquaintance with one another&rsquo;s work and a sense of
being parts of one enterprise. The <i>Herald of Gospel
Liberty</i> circulated widely. Stone had an agent in
New York for his <i>Christian Messenger</i>. When he reported,
in 1828, that &ldquo;the sect called Christians have,
in little more than a quarter of a century, risen from
nothing to 1,500 congregations with a membership of
150,000,&rdquo; his estimate&mdash;doubtless much too large in
any case&mdash;evidently includes all three, and his reference
to &ldquo;more than a quarter of a century&rdquo; shows that
he was thinking of beginnings earlier than the dissolution
of the Springfield Presbytery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="large">THE COMING OF THE CAMPBELLS</span></h2>
<p>Thomas Campbell, an Argyle Scot by lineage,
was born in North Ireland in 1763, took a full classical
course in the University of Glasgow, and after that
the full course in the theological seminary of the Anti-Burgher
section of the Seceder branch of the Scottish
Presbyterian Church. After preaching and teaching
for several years, he became the settled pastor of a
church at Ahorey, in County Armaugh, thirty miles
south of Belfast, where he remained from 1798 until
1807. Meanwhile he had married the daughter of a
French Huguenot family, and his son Alexander had
been born in 1788. While ministering to the Ahorey
church, he also conducted a private academy at the
neighboring town of Rich Hill. Throughout his life,
Thomas Campbell devoted more of his time to teaching
than to preaching.</p>
<p>The Seceder Presbyterians had split from the established
Church of Scotland in 1733 in protest against
the arrangement by which the right of appointing ministers
had been taken from the parishes and given to
lay &ldquo;patrons,&rdquo; or landlords, for whom the right to
appoint the parson went with their ownership of land.
No question of doctrine was involved in this secession.
The Seceders were, if anything, stricter Calvinists
than the Church of Scotland. Later, the Seceders
divided into Burghers and Anti-Burghers, and each of
these into New Lights and Old Lights, on fine points
concerning the relations of the church to the state.
These divisions were carried from Scotland to Ireland,
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
though the issues were irrelevant to conditions there.
Thomas Campbell was an Old Light, Anti-Burgher
Seceder Presbyterian. But he early outgrew any interest
in these divisive issues and sought ways of promoting
unity at least among the Seceders.</p>
<p>Aside from the odious examples of disunion before
his eyes, two other influences drew Thomas Campbell
toward a wider fellowship. One was the Independent
(Congregational) church at Rich Hill, a church of the
Scotch Independent type, strongly affected by the
ideas of Glas and Sandeman and the Haldane brothers.
Here he met the celebrated English evangelist,
Rowland Hill, who preached an ardent gospel that
took little account of sectarian boundaries, and the
eccentric John Walker of Dublin, who left the Episcopal
Church and resigned a fellowship in Trinity College
to lead an independent movement. Campbell was
already familiar with the writings of Glas and Sandeman
and with the work of the Haldanes. None of
these was explicitly an advocate of union; but they all
played down the doctrines and creeds which create
divisions and the ecclesiastical institutions which perpetuate
them; and all played up a warm evangelical
faith voluntarily accepted and a return to the simple
practices of the New Testament church.</p>
<p>The second influence which moved Mr. Campbell
toward a nonsectarian view of religion was the writings
of the philosopher, John Locke, especially his
<i>Letters Concerning Toleration</i>. In these essays Locke
had urged toleration, not only by the state toward dissenting
groups, but also by the church toward varieties
of theological opinion within itself. Sentences could
be quoted from Locke which sound as though they
came straight from the <i>Declaration and Address</i>. All
this rested on a philosophy carefully worked out in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
<i>Essay on the Human Understanding</i>. Thomas Campbell
diligently studied these two books by John Locke
and made them required reading for his son Alexander,
who never ceased to give them his unbounded admiration.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Seceding from the Seceders</span></h3>
<p>Partly because of ill health in his forties (he lived
to the age of ninety-one), and partly to find a place
of ampler opportunity for his seven children, Thomas
Campbell migrated to America in 1807, as many of his
Ulster neighbors had done before him. He landed at
Philadelphia on May 13, fortunately found the Associate
Synod of North America, which represented all
the Seceders in America, in session in that city, presented
his credentials and was received into the synod
on May 16, and two days later was appointed to the
Presbytery of Chartiers in southwestern Pennsylvania.
The minutes of the presbytery show that he had
preaching appointments at &ldquo;Buffaloe&rdquo; (now Bethany,
W. Va.), Pittsburgh, and other points beginning July
1. So, in less than three months after preaching his
farewell sermon in the Ahorey church in Ireland,
Thomas Campbell was ministering to a circuit of communities
on the American frontier.</p>
<p>But the connection so promptly made was not long
peacefully maintained. At the October meeting of
the presbytery, another minister filed charges against
him for heretical teaching and disorderly procedure,
and others testified unfavorably. After several confused
and stormy sessions, the presbytery suspended
Mr. Campbell. He appealed to the synod in Philadelphia
at its meeting the next year. There were extended
and complicated proceedings, culminating in a
formal trial in which he was found guilty on several
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
counts, and was sentenced to be &ldquo;rebuked and admonished.&rdquo;
At the same time the synod censured the
presbytery for its irregular and unfair handling of
the case. Evidently the synod did not think too badly
of Mr. Campbell, for it gave him appointments with the
Philadelphia churches for the summer and then sent
him back to resume his preaching in the Presbytery of
Chartiers. But the presbytery, smarting under the
synod&rsquo;s censure and the reversal of its act of suspension,
gave him a chilly reception. Specifically, it failed
to give him any preaching appointments, and a rule
of the church forbade a preacher to make his own.
Tensions and animosities developed until, on September
13, 1808, Thomas Campbell orally&mdash;and the next
day in writing&mdash;renounced the authority of both presbytery
and synod. From that act, severing his connection
with the Seceder Presbyterians, Thomas
Campbell never receded. But the presbytery continued
to summon him to appear and answer charges until,
a year and a half later, it gave him up as hopeless
and voted to depose him &ldquo;from the holy ministry and
from the sealing ordinances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What were the reasons for this break? Richardson,
in his <i>Memoirs of Alexander Campbell</i>, says that
Thomas Campbell gave offense first by inviting Presbyterians
other than Seceders to participate in the
communion service. This does not appear among the
written charges in the minutes of either the presbytery
or the synod, but it may well be true. He is quoted
as saying that the test of fitness to commune should
be only a &ldquo;general,&rdquo; not a &ldquo;particular,&rdquo; acceptance
of the Westminster Confession, and that he himself
would gladly commune with other Christians, Lutherans,
for example, if a church of his own order were
not available. Moreover, he admitted advising Seceders
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
to attend the preaching services of other churches
if none of their own was at hand.</p>
<p>The heart of the difficulty was that he said that &ldquo;the
church has no divine warrant for holding Confessions
of Faith as terms of communion&rdquo;; creeds may be useful
for teaching, but they should not be used as tests
of fellowship, because they contain some things that
cannot be proved by the Bible and many things that
ordinary people cannot understand. The only strictly
theological point related to the nature of &ldquo;saving
faith,&rdquo; which, in Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s view, did not necessarily
include a sense of &ldquo;assurance that we in particular
shall be saved.&rdquo; He had already moved far
toward the conception of faith as the rational belief
of testimony about Christ and trust in him, rather
than a mystical experience evidencing a special act of
divine grace in favor of the individual to assure him
that he had been accepted by God. Two other complaints
show that Mr. Campbell had been restless under
the restraints of the Presbyterian system. He had
preached, on invitation from the people, within the parish
or circuit of another minister without getting his
consent. And he had said that, in the absence of a
minister, &ldquo;ruling elders&rdquo; (who would be laymen)
might properly pray and exhort in public worship.</p>
<p>At this stage, then, it appears from the record that
Thomas Campbell did not radically reject either the
Calvinistic theology as a system of doctrine or the
Presbyterian polity as a system of church government,
though he was far on the way toward rejecting both.
His divergence from the Seceder Presbyterians can
be summed up under these points: (1) He wanted
closer relations with Christians of other denominations.
(2) He did not regard the creed as the standard
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
of truth or as an authoritative compendium of the
truths revealed in Scripture, but claimed for himself
and for every Christian the right to be judged and to
test the creed by reference to the plain teachings of
the Bible. (3) He held that acceptance of the creed in
detail should not be a condition of communion or fellowship.
(4) He was suspicious of clerical monopoly.
(5) He said that a feeling of assurance of salvation
was not of the essence of saving faith, though it might
accompany a high degree of such faith. (6) He held
that Christ died for all men, and that any man could
believe on him and be saved. This last point was his
most definite departure from Calvinism.</p>
<p>If the presbytery gave Campbell no preaching appointments
after the synod had sent him back &ldquo;rebuked
and admonished,&rdquo; naturally it gave him none
after he had renounced its authority. But he continued
to preach in private houses as opportunity offered.
None of the churches for which he had preached followed
him, and no Presbyterian ministers joined him
in withdrawing from the Presbytery of Chartiers. In
those respects his movement differed in its beginning
from that of O&rsquo;Kelly and from that of McNemar and
Stone. But in both of the earlier secessions the separatists
had been preaching in their districts for years,
and the ground had been plowed by revivals, and in
Kentucky the way had been prepared by the immigration
of many &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; ministers and laymen from
the East. Thomas Campbell, on the other hand, was
a newcomer from Ireland and made the break in a community
where there had been no such preparation and
where he had no wide acquaintance.</p>
<p>Before the final action expelling Mr. Campbell from
the Seceder Presbyterian ministry, a group of his
sympathizers and habitual hearers, meeting at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
home of Abraham Altars, between Mount Pleasant and
Washington, Pennsylvania, resolved to form a society
&ldquo;to give more definiteness to the movement in which
they had thus far been cooperating without any formal
organization or definite arrangement.&rdquo; The result
was the &ldquo;Christian Association of Washington,&rdquo; organized
August 17, 1809. It was agreed that a proper
motto would be, &ldquo;Where the Scriptures speak, we
speak; where the Scriptures are silent, we are silent.&rdquo;
One member protested that this would lead to giving
up infant baptism. The others thought not, but considered
it a sound principle wherever it might lead.
To express more fully the motives and purposes of
the association, Thomas Campbell drew up a <i>Declaration
and Address</i>, which was presented at a subsequent
meeting as the report of a committee of twenty-one.
(The total membership was not much more.) On
September 7, 1809, the association approved it and
ordered it printed.</p>
<p>It was exactly at this point that Alexander Campbell
arrived from Ireland by way of Scotland.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Alexander Campbell at Glasgow</span></h3>
<p>When Thomas Campbell came to America, he left
his family in Ireland. Alexander, then nineteen years
old, was to conduct his father&rsquo;s school at Rich Hill
until the end of the term and to bring his mother and
the six younger children to America when his father
gave the word. The word came when Thomas Campbell
had been in America about fifteen months. On
October 1, 1808, the family embarked at Londonderry.
Their ship ran aground on one of the rocky islands of
the Hebrides. During that experience, Alexander&rsquo;s
previous thought about devoting himself to the ministry
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
reached the point of a firm decision. The interruption
of the voyage so late in the sailing season
made it necessary to wait until spring for its continuance.
The shipwrecked travelers made their way to
Glasgow, where they remained almost an entire year.</p>
<p>This year in Glasgow proved to be very important.
It gave Alexander opportunity to supplement the excellent
instruction he had received from his father by
a year of study in the University of Glasgow. In addition,
it brought him into contact with the men from
whom, as his biographer, Richardson, says, he derived
&ldquo;his first impulse as a religious reformer.&rdquo; These
were representatives of the movement led and financed
by the brothers Robert and James Alexander Haldane.</p>
<p>Alexander Campbell came to Glasgow with a letter
of introduction to Mr. Greville Ewing, who was in
charge of the seminary, or training school for lay
preachers, which the Haldanes had established in that
city. Mr. Ewing became his closest and most helpful
friend during that year in Glasgow. Ewing had introduced
into his seminary the books of Glas and
Sandeman, whose teachings gave the strongest possible
emphasis to the restoration of primitive Christianity
in all details. In Ewing&rsquo;s conversation and
Glas&rsquo;s and Sandeman&rsquo;s books, Alexander Campbell
found not only the general concept of a needed restoration
of primitive Christianity but such specific
ideas as these: the independence of the local congregation;
weekly observance of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper; a
plurality of elders; the denial of clerical privileges
and dignities; the right and duty of laymen to have a
part in the edification and discipline of the church; and
a conception of faith as such a belief of testimony as
any man is capable of by the application of his natural
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
intelligence to the facts supplied by Scripture. The
Haldanes themselves, and some of the followers of
Sandeman, had adopted immersion, but Ewing adhered
to infant baptism and sprinkling.</p>
<p>The action of all these influences upon Alexander
Campbell&rsquo;s mind, and of his mind upon what he saw
and learned of Presbyterianism in Scotland, brought
him to a profound dissatisfaction with it. He had no
quarrel with its theology. Near the end of his year
in Glasgow, when he was examined by the Seceder
church to determine his fitness to partake of the communion&mdash;because
he brought no credentials, and the
Seceders were very careful to permit no unqualified
person to commune&mdash;no fault was found with his profession
of faith, and he received the &ldquo;token&rdquo; which
would admit him to the table. But at the communion
service, after postponing his decision to the last possible
moment, he laid down his token and walked out.
This was, in effect, his break with the Seceder Presbyterian
Church. He never went back.</p>
<p>Alexander Campbell and the family sailed for America
early in August, 1809, landed at New York on
September 29, and proceeded to Philadelphia by stage-coach
and thence westward by wagon. Word had been
sent ahead to Thomas Campbell, and he met them on
the road in western Pennsylvania, October 19, with a
copy of the freshly printed <i>Declaration and Address</i>
in his pocket. Father and son, with an ocean between
them, had independently broken with their religious
past and moved by converging paths toward the same
goal. Alexander read the <i>Declaration and Address</i>
and was enthusiastic about it. It marshaled him the
way that he was going.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">The &ldquo;Declaration and Address&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>The <i>Declaration and Address</i> is one of the most important
documents in the history of the Disciples. It
deserves not only reading in full but careful study.
As published in a later edition, it is a pamphlet of
fifty-six pages containing four parts: first, a Declaration
(3 pages) stating briefly the plans and purposes
of the Christian Association of Washington; second,
an Address (18 pages), signed by Thomas Campbell
and Thomas Acheson, giving an extended argument
for the unity of all Christians and amplifying the principles
on which the church can regain its original unity
and purity; third, an Appendix (31 pages) explaining
several points in the Address; fourth, a Postscript (3
pages), written three months later, suggesting steps
to be taken for the promotion of the movement.</p>
<p>The Declaration states the aim and the means of
attaining it. The aim: &ldquo;unity, peace, and purity.&rdquo;
The means: &ldquo;rejecting human opinions, ... returning
to, and holding fast by, the original standard.&rdquo;
The method of procedure is outlined under nine heads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The formation of a religious association &ldquo;for the
sole purpose of promoting simple evangelical Christianity,
free from all mixture of human opinions and
inventions of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. Contributions &ldquo;to support a pure Gospel Ministry,
that shall reduce to practice that whole form of
doctrine, worship, discipline, and government, expressly
revealed and enjoined in the word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3. The formation of similar societies.</p>
<p>4. The Christian Association of Washington is not
a church, but an organization of &ldquo;voluntary advocates
for church reformation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>5. The association will support only such ministers
as conform to &ldquo;the original standard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6. A committee of twenty-one, chosen annually, shall
transact the business of the association.</p>
<p>7. Meetings shall be held twice a year.</p>
<p>8. An order of business for the meetings.</p>
<p>9. The association agrees to support those ministers
whom it shall invite to assist &ldquo;in promoting a pure
evangelical reformation, by the simple preaching of the
everlasting gospel, and the administration of its ordinances
in an exact conformity to the Divine Standard.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Address opens, and for many pages continues,
with a picture of the &ldquo;awful and distressing effects&rdquo;
of division among Christians, an impassioned plea for
unity, an argument that conditions in America are
uniquely favorable for a union effort, and a restatement
of the causes of division and the basis of union.
Mr. Campbell revealed the central principle of his
endeavor, the ground of his hope for its success, and
the breadth of his tolerance, when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is, to us, a pleasing consideration that all the
churches of Christ, which mutually acknowledge
each other as such, are not only agreed in the
great doctrines of faith and holiness; but are also
materially agreed, as to the positive ordinances of
Gospel institution; so that our differences, at most,
are about the things in which the kingdom of God
does not consist, that is, about matters of private
opinion, or human invention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Address then lays down thirteen numbered propositions,
which, in condensed form, are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. &ldquo;The church of Christ upon earth is essentially,
intentionally, and constitutionally one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>2. Congregations locally separate ought to be in fellowship
with one another.</p>
<p>3. Nothing ought to be an article of faith, a term of
communion, or a rule for the constitution and management
of the church except what is expressly taught
by Christ and his apostles.</p>
<p>4. &ldquo;The New Testament is as perfect a constitution
for the worship, discipline and government of the New
Testament church, and as perfect a rule for the particular
duties of its members; as the Old Testament
was ... for ... the Old Testament Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5. The church can give no new commandments where
the Scriptures are silent.</p>
<p>6. Inferences and deductions from Scripture may be
true doctrine, but they are not binding on the consciences
of Christians further than they perceive them
to be so.</p>
<p>7. Creeds may be useful for instruction but must not
be used as tests of fitness for membership in the
church.</p>
<p>8. Full knowledge of all revealed truth is not necessary
to entitle persons to membership, &ldquo;neither should
they, for this purpose, be required to make a profession
more extensive than their knowledge.&rdquo; Realization
of their need of salvation, faith in Christ as
Savior, and obedience to him are all that is necessary.</p>
<p>9. All who are thus qualified should love each other
as brothers and be united.</p>
<p>10. &ldquo;Division among christians is a horrid evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>11. Divisions have been caused, in some cases, by
neglect of the expressly revealed will of God; in others,
by assuming authority to make human opinions the
test of fellowship or to introduce human inventions
into the faith and practice of the church.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>12. All that is needed for the purity and perfection
of the church is that it receive those, and only those,
who profess faith in Christ and obey him according
to the Scriptures, that it retain them only so long as
their conduct is in accord with their profession, that
ministers teach only what is expressly revealed, and
that all divine ordinances be observed as the New
Testament church observed them.</p>
<p>13. When the church adopts necessary &ldquo;expedients,&rdquo;
they should be recognized for what they are and
should not be confused with divine commands, so that
they will give no occasion for division.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Appendix explains and clarifies several points
in the foregoing and answers possible objections.</p>
<p>The Postscript, written after the committee of
twenty-one had held its first monthly meeting, December
14, 1809, makes two suggestions. The first is that
there be prepared &ldquo;a catechetical exhibition of the
fulness and precision of the holy scriptures upon the
entire subject of christianity&mdash;an exhibition of that
complete system of faith and duty expressly contained
in the sacred oracles; respecting the doctrine, worship,
discipline, and government of the christian
church.&rdquo; Fortunately, this was never done. The
second suggestion is that a monthly magazine be published,
to be called the <i>Christian Monitor</i>, to be started
when 500 subscribers were secured, and to be devoted
to &ldquo;detecting and exposing the various anti-christian
enormities, innovations and corruptions, which infect
the christian church.&rdquo; This project also was dropped,
and it was not until thirteen years later, and in the
hands of Alexander Campbell, that the <i>Christian Baptist</i>
took the assignment of &ldquo;detecting and exposing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>At this distance in time it is not easy to see how
the author and signers of the <i>Declaration and Address</i>
could suppose that they would be able to &ldquo;reduce to
practice that whole form of doctrine, worship, discipline,
and government, expressly revealed&rdquo; without
employing any opinions of their own in interpreting
the revelation, when they clearly saw that those who
had attempted this before them had produced discordant
and divisive systems. They were sounding
their prophetic and unifying note when they declared,
in the same document, that the basis of fellowship is
not agreement on any complete system of doctrine and
church practice, but is the simple and saving essentials
of the gospel upon which Christians generally
are already agreed.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">The Brush Run Church</span></h3>
<p>Alexander Campbell, newly arrived on the scene of
this nascent reformation, immediately settled down to
a strenuous course of private study&mdash;Bible, Greek,
Hebrew, Latin, and church history. He preached his
first sermon on July 15, 1810, in a private house. He
had no license to preach and he was a member of no
church, for he had left his Presbyterianism in Scotland,
and the Christian Association of Washington
was not yet a church. He preached a hundred times
during the next twelve months.</p>
<p>After Thomas Campbell had applied for admission
to the regular (not Seceder) Presbyterian Synod of
Pittsburgh, and had been rejected, the Christian Association
of Washington constituted itself a church, on
May 4, 1811. This became the first church among Disciples
of Christ in the Campbell strain of their lineage.
The new church chose Thomas Campbell as elder,
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
elected four deacons, and licensed Alexander Campbell
to preach. It observed the Lord&rsquo;s Supper the next
day, and thereafter every Lord&rsquo;s day. A simple building
was erected&mdash;the Brush Run Church&mdash;and the first
service was held in it on June 16, 1811. Alexander
Campbell was ordained on the first day of the next
January.</p>
<p>The subject of baptism had not yet been seriously
considered. Some members of the group, and some
of its critics, doubted whether the principles of the
<i>Declaration and Address</i> were consistent with infant
baptism and sprinkling. Thomas Campbell was not
disturbed about it. Stating his views to the Synod
of Pittsburgh, he had said that infant baptism is not a
command of Christ, hence not a condition of membership
in the church, but that it is a matter of forbearance.
Three members of the Brush Run Church, soon
after its organization, refused to commune because
they had not been baptized. These had not even been
sprinkled, yet they had been admitted to membership.
&ldquo;Forbearance&rdquo; had extended so far. At their urgent
request, Thomas Campbell immersed them&mdash;somewhat
reluctantly, it may be surmised, for he did it without
going into the water himself. At that time Alexander
Campbell said: &ldquo;As I am sure it is unscriptural to
make this matter [baptism] a term of communion, I
let it slip. I wish to think and let think on these
matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost a year later, the birth of his first child forced
the question of infant baptism upon his attention and
drove him to a study of the whole subject. The result
was the conviction that the sprinkling of infants was
not baptism within the meaning of the New Testament.
On June 12, 1812, Thomas and Alexander Campbell,
their wives, and three other members of the church
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
were immersed in Buffalo Creek by a Baptist preacher,
on a simple confession of faith in Christ. Most of
the members of the Brush Run Church soon followed
this example. Those who did not, withdrew.</p>
<p>The adoption of immersion in this way, as the unvarying
practice of the church and therefore as an
item in the proposed platform for the union of all
churches, radically changed the program of the movement.
It had begun with the idea that the churches
were divided by human opinions that had been added
to a perfectly adequate common core of revealed truth
and duty which all accepted. But now the Reformers
could no longer say, as Thomas Campbell had said,
that all the churches &ldquo;are agreed in the great doctrines
of faith and holiness and as to the positive ordinances
of the Gospel institution.&rdquo; To achieve union
no longer required only persuading the churches to
unite upon something that they already held. Now, it
became necessary to persuade them also to accept one
&ldquo;positive ordinance&rdquo; which only the Baptists believed
to be commanded in the New Testament.</p>
<p>But if the adoption of immersion erected a barrier
between the Reformers and the other churches, it
brought them closer to the Baptists. In the autumn
of 1813 the Brush Run Church applied for admission
to the Redstone Baptist Association, at the same time
submitting a full written statement of its position, including
its protest against creeds. The application
was accepted, over the protest of some of the Baptist
ministers. For the next seventeen years, the Reformers
were, as Walter Scott said, &ldquo;in the bosom of the
Regular Baptist churches.&rdquo; But they did not lose
their sense of mission or merge indistinguishably in
the Baptist denomination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="large">WITH THE BAPTISTS, 1813-30</span></h2>
<p>After the Brush Run Church had joined the Redstone
Baptist Association, Alexander Campbell
began to preach more widely among the Baptist
churches of the region. Thomas Campbell, who was
more occupied with teaching than with preaching,
rather rapidly dropped out of his position of leadership,
which was taken over by his son. Alexander
had married the daughter of a well-to-do farmer, and
his father-in-law had deeded to him the farm which
was to be the nucleus of his large Bethany estate, part
of which became the campus of Bethany College thirty
years later. Even at the age of twenty-five he enjoyed
economic security and was well on the way toward
becoming a substantial citizen.</p>
<p>At a meeting of the Redstone Baptist Association in
August, 1816, Alexander Campbell preached his famous
&ldquo;Sermon on the Law.&rdquo; There seems to have
been some scheming to keep him off the program, and
he was called in only at the last moment to fill a vacancy.
But the content of the sermon, if not its form,
had evidently been the subject of long and careful
study. The central point of it was that the Christian
system is not a continuation of the Jewish regime but
is based on a new covenant which, though prepared for
and prophesied in the religion of the Old Testament,
is a radically new thing. Therefore, he said, no arguments
can be drawn from the Old Testament about the
nature or form of Christian institutions. The law of
the Sabbath has nothing to do with the observance of
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
the first day of the week; baptism cannot be understood
by considering it as taking the place of circumcision;
paying tithes and keeping fasts are no part of
a Christian&rsquo;s duty; and any alliance between church
and state, as in the old covenant of God with the Hebrews,
is alien to the spirit and nature of Christianity.</p>
<p>Some of these conclusions&mdash;especially separation of
church and state and the denial of any analogy between
baptism and circumcision&mdash;were pleasing to the Baptist
audience. But the basis of the argument, the complete
abrogation of the Old Testament law, seemed
to many a dangerous doctrine. The preachers who
heard the sermon went out to spread among the
churches their fears that this bold and brilliant young
man might be a disturber of Baptist usage. Thereafter
he &ldquo;itinerated less&rdquo; among the Baptist churches
and confined his labors to &ldquo;three or four little communities
constituted on the Bible, one in Ohio, one in Virginia
and two in Pennsylvania.&rdquo; But he also made
one or two preaching trips a year among the regular
Baptists. He opened in 1818, and conducted for four
years, a boarding school for boys, especially with a
view to finding and training candidates for the ministry.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Debates on Baptism</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s Baptist colleagues may have considered
him heretical about the covenants, but they
could not fail to value him as a champion of immersion.
So when a Seceder Presbyterian minister, John
Walker of Mt. Pleasant, Ohio, issued a challenge for a
debate on that topic, they urged him to accept it. Mr.
Walker, as challenger, affirmed that the infant children
of believers are proper subjects for baptism and that
sprinkling is a proper mode. As to the baptism of
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
infants, he rested his case almost wholly on the proposition
&ldquo;that baptism came in the room of circumcision,
that the covenant on which the Jewish church
was built and to which circumcision is the seal, is the
same with the covenant on which the Christian church
is built and to which Baptism is the seal.&rdquo; This is
precisely the proposition that Mr. Campbell had denied
in his &ldquo;Sermon on the Law,&rdquo; and it gave him opportunity
to elaborate and reinforce his argument as to
the radical newness of Christianity and its freedom
from Old Testament law. In addition, he made use
of his careful studies of the Greek word <i>baptizein</i> and
the prepositions used with it in the passages describing
baptism. He quoted pedobaptist lexicographers
and commentators to prove that the Greek verb means
&ldquo;to immerse&rdquo;; and he stressed the distinction between
&ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;moral&rdquo; precepts to show that the
former, including baptism, demand implicit obedience
with no reasoning on our part as to the expediency
or value of the thing commanded.</p>
<p>The debate with Walker was held at Mt. Pleasant,
Ohio, in June, 1820. It greatly enhanced Campbell&rsquo;s
reputation, especially among the Baptists of the Mahoning
Association in eastern Ohio, and brought him
many invitations to preach in the churches of this association.
The publication of the debate as a book
gave much wider publicity to his ideas and brought
on another debate, in October, 1823, with W. L. Maccalla,
a Presbyterian minister of Augusta, Kentucky.
This debate was held at Washington, Mason County,
Kentucky. On the horseback trip from his home to
that place, Mr. Campbell was accompanied by Sidney
Rigdon, then a young Baptist minister in Pittsburgh,
later one of the three who constituted the &ldquo;first presidency&rdquo;
of the Mormon Church and still later a rival
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
of Brigham Young for its leadership after the death of
the &ldquo;prophet&rdquo; Joseph Smith. The text of Campbell&rsquo;s
side of the discussion, as subsequently published, is
based on Rigdon&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>In the Maccalla debate, Campbell began to develop
his theory of the design of baptism. Baptism is appropriate
for penitent believers, not for innocent infants,
because it is the &ldquo;washing of regeneration,&rdquo; designed
to cleanse, not from inherited original sin, but from
the guilt of actual personal sins. Yet it is not a magical
&ldquo;water salvation,&rdquo; though he was often accused
of teaching that. &ldquo;The blood of Christ <i>really</i> cleanses
us who believe.... The water of baptism <i>formally</i>
washes away our sins.&rdquo; This distinction was never
again so clearly stated, and it may be argued that it
represents a stage through which Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s
thought passed, rather than a conclusion on which it
rested. However, it brought into prominence the conception
of &ldquo;baptism for the remission of sins.&rdquo; When
the distinction between &ldquo;real&rdquo; and &ldquo;formal&rdquo; remission
was dropped, other ways were found for avoiding
the morally repugnant conclusion that, if remission
comes by baptism and only immersion is baptism, then
the unimmersed must necessarily be damned. Neither
Campbell nor the Disciples after him ever believed
that.</p>
<p>The journey to Kentucky to meet Maccalla was the
first of Alexander Campbell&rsquo;s many visits to Kentucky.
It put him in touch with men and churches that were
going his way&mdash;the &ldquo;Christians,&rdquo; and a strain among
the Baptists that was to furnish powerful reinforcement
to his cause. And on that long journey by horseback
he carried in his saddlebags copies of the first
issue of his new magazine, the <i>Christian Baptist</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<h3 class="generic">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Reforming Baptists</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The <i>Christian Baptist</i> began in 1823 and continued
for seven years. Mr. Campbell was his own publisher.
He set up a printing office on his farm, secured the
location of the post office of Buffaloe (later Bethany),
and was appointed postmaster. The magazine
took up at once the delayed task of &ldquo;detecting and exposing
the various anti-christian enormities, innovations
and corruptions which infect the christian
church.&rdquo; It was small, as a hornet is small, and its
sting was as keen. It attacked especially three characteristics
of the existing churches: the authority and
status assumed by the clergy; unscriptural organizations,
such as synods and church courts, missionary
societies, Bible societies, Sunday schools, and all kinds
of &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; and &ldquo;popular schemes&rdquo;; and the
use of creeds. There was loud outcry that it sowed
the seeds of discord among the churches. It certainly
did. Mr. Campbell would have said that there must
always be discord when truth is boldly proclaimed and
error is stubbornly held.</p>
<p>On the constructive side, the magazine used much
space in developing&mdash;as the Postscript had suggested
doing in a catechism&mdash;&ldquo;that complete system of faith
and duty expressly contained in the Sacred Oracles respecting
the doctrine, worship and government of the
church.&rdquo; A few years later it was said that Mr.
Campbell now became the advocate of &ldquo;a particular
ecclesiastical order.&rdquo; To him it was the order of the
apostolic church. For a time, little attention was
paid to Christian unity. This objective was not forgotten,
but it was held that emphasis should be first
upon the pattern and procedure of the primitive church
as the only ground upon which Christians could unite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>All this produced an upheaval among the Baptist
churches within the area of Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s personal
and journalistic influence&mdash;and it was a considerable
area. Since the Redstone Association, to which the
Brush Run Church belonged, for the most part resisted
his ideas in their earlier statement, he had formed a
new Baptist church in the town which is now Wellsburg,
on the Ohio River, seven miles from Bethany,
and secured its admission into the Mahoning Association
of eastern Ohio. But in 1826, ten Redstone
churches that stood firm for the Philadelphia Confession
and Baptist usages cut off thirteen that leaned
toward the Reformers, and the thirteen joined the
Washington (Pa.) Association, thereby overbalancing
it in the same direction. The Mahoning Association
became thoroughly permeated by the idea of restoring
primitive practice. The church at Hiram, for example,
abandoned its church covenant, constitution, and Confession
of Faith to adopt &ldquo;the Bible alone&rdquo; as its
standard; and all the others were following fast in the
same way. Many Baptist churches in western Pennsylvania
and Virginia contained large minorities, if
not actual majorities, favorable to the &ldquo;restoration&rdquo;
program. One can understand the distress of Rev.
Robert Semple, who, speaking as one quite satisfied
with the Baptist position, said that the <i>Christian
Baptist</i> was &ldquo;more mischievous than any publication
I have ever known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ferment in Kentucky was even more acute. For
more than twenty years the Baptists in that state,
while gaining rapidly in numbers, had been troubled
by dissension concerning some of their Calvinistic doctrines
and questions growing out of them&mdash;election,
whether Christ died for all; the nature of faith,
whether saving faith requires a special enabling act by
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
the Holy Spirit for each individual; and the kind of
&ldquo;experience&rdquo; a converted man ought to have. Some
associations had divided on one or more of these issues.
Camp-meeting methods, developed in and after the
&ldquo;great revival,&rdquo; offended some by their disorderly
enthusiasm, gratified others by their offer of salvation
to all. The &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; churches, which provided a
continuing series of revivals with Methodistic coloration,
attracted those who wanted freedom both from
the rigid theology of the old creeds and from the Methodist
and Presbyterian systems of centralized control
over ministers and local churches.</p>
<p>Stirred by these influences, many Kentucky Baptists
were ready for a call to follow a &ldquo;reformer.&rdquo; The
<i>Christian Baptist</i>, the Maccalla debate in 1823, and Mr.
Campbell&rsquo;s extensive tour through Kentucky the next
year furnished the call.</p>
<p>One of its most eager and receptive hearers was
&ldquo;Raccoon&rdquo; John Smith. He was a frontiersman with
little formal education but with a keen mind, a free
spirit, and a passion for preaching the gospel. In
1824, when he met Campbell, he was forty years old
(four years older than Campbell) and had been an
ordained Baptist minister for sixteen years. Within
the next year he began to preach in the way of the
Reformers&mdash;the gospel for all, a simple faith in Christ
such as is common to all sects, no creed, every man
able to believe and repent, no miraculous &ldquo;experience&rdquo;
needed. Charges of un-Baptistic teaching were
brought against him at an annual meeting of the
North District Association and were to be acted upon
the next year. Meanwhile he went forth to evangelize
and before the next meeting of the association he had
won so many converts and organized so many new
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
churches &ldquo;on the Bible alone&rdquo; that the charges had
to be dropped. In April, 1830, this association formally
adopted the principles of the Reformers, but did
not at that time dissolve. Within the year, three or
four other Baptist associations had taken similar action.
At the same time, through the work of other
Baptist preachers who cast in their lot with the new
movement, many new independent churches had been
formed, and some old churches had dropped the Baptist
name. As early as 1825 the Baptist church in
Louisville, of which P. S. Fall was pastor, voted to
give up the Philadelphia Confession and take the Bible
alone. Jacob Creath, Sr., and Jacob Creath, Jr., and
John Smith evangelized so widely and so successfully
that the new movement gathered a considerable following
from the previously unconverted as well as from
the Baptist churches. By the end of 1830, the Reformers&mdash;&ldquo;Campbellites&rdquo;
to their opponents&mdash;were a
clearly recognizable element in Kentucky, though most
of them were still nominally Baptists.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Walter Scott, the &ldquo;Gospel Restored&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>But the events which were most decisive in changing
the Reformers from &ldquo;Reforming Baptists&rdquo; to an independent
group to be known as Disciples occurred in
the Mahoning Association in eastern Ohio. The man
who had most to do with these events was Walter
Scott. Born in Edinburgh in 1796 and educated in
the university of that city, Scott was still a member
of the Church of Scotland when he came to New York
immediately after his graduation and to Pittsburgh
the next year. Here he taught in a school conducted
by a Mr. Forrester, who was also the leader of a church
of immersed Haldaneans&mdash;locally known as &ldquo;kissing
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
Baptists.&rdquo; Scott joined this church. To gain a better
understanding of the restoration of primitive practices,
he visited similar churches in New York, Paterson,
New Jersey, Baltimore, and Washington. He
found that they did not entirely agree as to just what
the practice of the primitive church was. He returned
to Pittsburgh much depressed, but resumed his teaching
and studied the writings of Locke, Glas, Sandeman,
and Haldane to clarify his religious ideas. The sudden
death of Mr. Forrester threw upon him the care of the
little church. His first meeting with Mr. Campbell,
his senior by eight years, was at Pittsburgh in the
winter of 1821-22. They met occasionally during the
next year, and the contact brought Scott out of his
fog. When Campbell was planning his magazine, it
was Scott who suggested the name, &ldquo;Christian Baptist,&rdquo;
as an indication that the aim was to work with
and through the Baptists, not to promote a defection
from them.</p>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s chief interest was in defining the process by
which one becomes a Christian. That had really been
the central point in Thomas Campbell&rsquo;s original concern,
for this, in his view, would define the terms of
fellowship and become the basis of union. But attention
had been diverted to developing a complete pattern
for the restoration of the church on the primitive
model. To the first four issues of the <i>Christian Baptist</i>,
Scott contributed a series of articles on &ldquo;A Divinely
Authorized Plan of Preaching the Christian Religion.&rdquo;
The plan of preaching it and the plan of
accepting it must naturally be the same. There must
be the right elements in the right order. He found that
the exact steps, authoritatively given as constituting
the way to salvation, were these: (1) Faith, the persuasion
of the mind by rational evidence. &ldquo;The messiahship
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
rests on demonstration,&rdquo; and everything else
follows from that on authority. (2) Repentance of
sins, under the motive of the promises. (3) Baptism,
in obedience to divine command. (4) Remission of
sins, and (5) the gift of the Holy Spirit, both in fulfillment
of God&rsquo;s promise, which is conditioned on
man&rsquo;s completion of the first three steps.</p>
<p>These became the five points of Scott&rsquo;s standard
sermon and the outline of a tremendously effective
evangelistic appeal. These points were all implicit in
what Campbell was teaching, but so long as they remained
implicit they could not win converts; they could
only change some regular Baptists into Reforming
Baptists, and divide Baptist churches and associations.
The Mahoning Association was more thoroughly imbued
with Campbell&rsquo;s views than any other; yet at its
annual meeting in 1827 all its churches together (excepting
Campbell&rsquo;s own church at Wellsburg, which
did a little better) reported only twenty-one additions
for the year&mdash;and there had been twelve excommunications.
It was agreed to appoint an evangelist to
&ldquo;travel and teach among the churches.&rdquo; Scott, who
had moved to Steubenville, Ohio, within the boundaries
of the association, and who had visited its meetings
twice at Campbell&rsquo;s invitation and preached before it
once, was asked to accept this appointment. He was
not a member of the association, not a Baptist, not
an ordained minister. With the Mahoning Association
in 1827, evidently being a Reformer counted for more
than being a Baptist.</p>
<p>It was a good appointment. Scott began his work at
New Lisbon, Ohio. The first convert under his new
presentation of the &ldquo;ancient gospel&rdquo; was William
Amend, who, according to Scott&rsquo;s biographer, Baxter,
&ldquo;was beyond all question the first person in modern
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
times who received the ordinance of baptism in perfect
accordance with apostolic teaching and usage.&rdquo; That
was on November 18, 1827. The force and freshness
of Scott&rsquo;s appeal, the exciting sense of discovery, the
thought that an ancient treasure of divine truth was
just now being brought to light after being lost for
centuries, the sense of witnessing the dawn of a new
epoch in the history of Christianity&mdash;these things gave
to the campaign an extraordinary quality. It was different
from other revivals. Here was no debauch of
emotion, but an attractive blending of rationality and
authority. It appealed to common sense as well as to
Scripture. It assumed man&rsquo;s rational ability to understand
what he ought to do and why, and his moral ability
to do it. The first three steps were man&rsquo;s; the
other two were God&rsquo;s. When the convert had believed,
repented, and obeyed (i.e., been baptized), he could be
perfectly sure that he would be saved by the remission
of his sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit and eternal
life. He had the promise of God for it.</p>
<p>Scott&rsquo;s work extended throughout eastern Ohio. Besides
completing the conquest of the Mahoning Association
for the Reform, it gained great numbers of converts&mdash;many
from other denominations but many also,
probably more, who had been members of no church.
New churches were organized. Some of the Baptist
preachers entered vigorously into the new movement,
and some of the new converts&mdash;such as William Hayden,
A. S. Hayden, and John Henry&mdash;became preachers
of great power. The first year of this new evangelism
brought more than 1,000 additions to the churches
of the Mahoning Association, more than doubling their
total membership. Scott was assisted at times by
Joseph Gaston, a &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; preacher who was, Scott
says, the first of that church who &ldquo;received the gospel
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
after its restoration.&rdquo; At the 1828 meeting of the
association, William Hayden was added to the staff,
and the next year Bentley and Bosworth.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Separation from the Baptists</span></h3>
<p>In three years, the Mahoning Association had lost
every distinctive Baptist characteristic except its form
and name as a Baptist association. Scott&rsquo;s rigid devotion
to the idea of reproducing the practice of the
primitive church led him to the conviction that there
was no warrant for associations. He suggested that
the association be dissolved and persuaded Mr. Campbell
not to oppose this action, as he was inclined to
do. A resolution to that effect was passed.</p>
<p>The actual separation of the Reformers&mdash;hereafter
to be called Disciples&mdash;from the Baptists was a process
which had begun two or three years earlier and
which continued for at least three years after this
event. But if a single date must be set for the beginning
of the Disciples of Christ as a separate and independent
religious body, it is in August, 1830, with the
dissolution of the Mahoning Association at Austintown,
Ohio.</p>
<p>The doctrines and practices of the Disciples which
distinguished them from the Baptists at the time of
the separation may be summarized:</p>
<p><i>As to doctrine</i>: (1) The distinction between the old
and new covenants, with consequent reliance solely
upon the New Testament as a source for instruction
concerning Christian faith and institutions. (2) The
design of baptism, for remission of sins; faith, repentance,
and baptism constitute regeneration. (3) The
nature of faith as the belief of testimony, a rational
act of which any man is capable in the exercise of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
natural powers and free will. (4) The operation of
the Holy Spirit through the Word alone in conversion.
(5) Rejection of the Calvinistic idea (which not all
Baptists held) that Christ died for only the &ldquo;elect,&rdquo;
a limited number of predetermined individuals.</p>
<p><i>As to practice</i>: (1) Rejection of creeds and church
covenants. (2) Reception of members on confession
of faith in Christ, repentance, and baptism, without
examination, the relation of an &ldquo;experience,&rdquo; or a
vote by the congregation. (3) Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper may be administered by any believer. (4)
Weekly observance of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. (5) No
special &ldquo;call&rdquo; to the ministry expected or required
and, in general, no sharp distinction between clergy
and laity. (6) Denial of the authority of associations
to exercise any power over local congregations (Baptists
also denied this in theory), or to pass any judgment
upon them, or to lay down conditions of fellowship
and communion, as Baptist associations did when
they excluded delegates who did not bring assurance
that their churches adhered to the Philadelphia Confession.</p>
<p>While the movement toward separation from the
Baptists was approaching its crisis, two events occurred,
both in 1829, which added greatly to the fame
and prestige of Alexander Campbell and thus helped
indirectly to get the Disciples off to a good start.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell was elected and served as a member
of the Virginia Constitutional Convention. He answered
those who criticized this entry into politics by
saying that he wanted to urge the abolition of slavery
or at least some steps in that direction. But he found
that it would be impossible to do anything about slavery
until the system of representation was so altered
as to take away the concentration of power that was
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
in the hands of the slave-owning aristocracy in the
eastern part of the state. He fought a magnificent but
losing fight on the floor of the convention for the abolition
of the property qualification for voting and for
representation in proportion to population. In advocating
these democratic measures he faced, almost
alone, such champions as John Marshall, John Randolph,
and ex-presidents Madison and Monroe, all of
whom were members of the convention. Anyone who
doubts the intellectual and moral stature of Alexander
Campbell will find a convincing demonstration of both
by reading, in the published proceedings of the convention,
his speeches in debate with these giants.</p>
<p>A few months earlier, Mr. Campbell had engaged in
a debate with the noted British social reformer, philanthropist,
and skeptic, Robert Owen, on the general subject
of the validity of the claims of Christianity and a
religious versus a secular and materialistic view of
the world. In his two earlier debates he had represented
the Baptists against the Presbyterians. In
his two later ones, he defended Protestantism against
Roman Catholicism and certain aspects of the Disciples&rsquo;
position against its critics. But in the debate
with Owen he had his most eminent opponent and his
most exalted theme&mdash;the &ldquo;Evidences of Christianity.&rdquo;
For this occasion he was not the advocate of a party
or a particular system of religious ideas, but was the
champion of all Christianity. His own movement entered
upon its independent existence with some of the
glory of this splendid performance upon it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="large">FIRST YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE, 1830-49</span></h2>
<p>With the dissolution of the Mahoning Association,
the Disciples became a separate people with
churches of their own, which were generally called
&ldquo;Churches of Christ.&rdquo; The disbanding of several Baptist
associations in Kentucky within the next few
months and the division of others added to the number
of churches in the new body. Scattered through
the entire area which had been affected by the teaching
of Mr. Campbell and the <i>Christian Baptist</i> were many
churches which were ready to follow the Reform, or
had already begun to do so. Some of these voluntarily
withdrew from the Baptist associations with which
they were connected; others were put out. And in
Baptist churches which adhered to their old position,
the individuals or minority groups who accepted the
new way were generally excluded. One point should
be made clear: there is no known record of any case
in which the Reforming, or Disciple, element in what
had been a Baptist church ever excluded those who insisted
on continuing to be Baptists.</p>
<p>By 1833 the Disciples had been pretty thoroughly
eliminated from the Baptist churches, to the number
of something like twenty thousand members, nearly
all in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, and
Tennessee. Their most important accomplishments
during the next two decades were: the growth of a
conscious fellowship and the sense of being a united
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
group; the union with the greater part of the western
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo; churches; the development of institutions,
customs, and procedures by which their common life
and purpose could be expressed; and a remarkable increase
in numbers and geographical extent.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell brought the <i>Christian Baptist</i> to an
end with the completion of its seventh volume and
immediately began the publication of the <i>Millennial
Harbinger</i>, January, 1830. This was a larger magazine,
devoted less to &ldquo;detecting and exposing&rdquo; the corruptions
of the divided churches than to presenting a
constructive program for curing their ills. Moreover,
it had the responsibility, as the earlier magazine had
not, of reporting the news of a movement which had
now become a going concern and of discussing the
problems which arose in the life of the new body.
The name does not indicate any special interest in
what is generally called the &ldquo;millennium,&rdquo; as implying
a visible second coming of Christ in the near future.
The kind of millennium of which this magazine
proposed to be the harbinger was the triumph of the
Kingdom of God on earth. If that was ever to come,
the editor thought, it could be only when the church
had been purified and united.</p>
<p>The <i>Millennial Harbinger</i> appeared monthly from
1830 to 1870. Mr. Campbell was its editor for nearly
thirty years. During this time it was the backbone
of Disciples&rsquo; periodical literature. A great many small
monthlies very soon began to spring up. Most of them
had small circulation and short life, but their total
influence was great, and a few became important. A
list printed in 1845, and not claiming to be complete,
names fifteen monthlies and two weeklies in existence
at that time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Disciples and Christians</span></h3>
<p>The union between the Disciples and the Christian
churches in Kentucky and adjacent states west of the
Alleghenies was an event of the utmost importance
for the whole movement. Since the churches of both
groups exercised a high degree of local independence,
union could not have been brought about by any binding
act of conferences or conventions, even if there
had been general conferences or conventions in either
party, as there were not. It had to depend upon a contagion
of fellowship between their congregations in
many communities. But the process was rapid, and
the union may be dated as of 1832. It began with a
consultation among some of their leaders on the first
day of that year and was far enough advanced to
insure its success before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Barton W. Stone and Alexander Campbell first met
in 1824. They were friends from the start, and both
were impressed by the similarity of their pleas for
simple and evangelical Christianity. In 1826 Mr. Stone
began the publication of a monthly, the <i>Christian Messenger</i>,
at Georgetown, Kentucky. In a communion
having no general organization and no cooperative
work, it was his position as editor which, more than
anything else, gave him the prominence that has led
to calling the Christian church in Kentucky, not very
accurately, &ldquo;the Stone movement.&rdquo; Since he wrote
constantly and copiously for his magazine and also
published reports of the activities of the churches and
evangelists, it gives a good contemporary picture of his
mind and of the principles and practices of the Christian
churches during the years immediately before the
union.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>The unity of all Christians was the theme of a series
of articles which began in the first issue of the <i>Christian
Messenger</i>, and the topic frequently recurs. Stone
gives the arguments for unity and states and answers
the possible objections. The principal obstacle to
union, as he sees it, is insistence upon doctrinal agreement.
Stone is for tolerance on all matters of opinion.
Yet there are some doctrines in the orthodox creeds
which Stone considers so erroneous that he is not content
to say that they ought not to be made tests of fellowship;
he must try to disprove them and eliminate
them from the minds of all Christians. These are the
generally accepted doctrines of the Trinity, the nature
of Christ, and the atonement. Upon each of these
subjects Mr. Stone wrote many long articles and editorials.
He did not hesitate to say that &ldquo;we deny the
Trinity,&rdquo; not because it is mysterious but because it
is not a revealed doctrine. The character of God is
revealed, but not his essence or the mode of his existence.
Christ was the Son of God, being of the same
nature but not of the same substance. The Holy Spirit
&ldquo;means the power or energy of God, never a third
person in deity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not surprising that the orthodox denominations
regarded the writer of these statements as a dangerous
man and the &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; as rank heretics. The
orthodox, and especially the Presbyterians, would have
been sensitive about such statements at any time; but
just at this time they were in a more than usually
suspicious mood, for the first year of the <i>Christian
Messenger</i> (1826) was the very year in which the
Unitarian, Dr. Horace Holley, had been dismissed from
the presidency of Transylvania University, and Kentucky
was still ringing with the conflict between the
orthodox and the &ldquo;liberals.&rdquo; So it was inevitable that
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
the charge of &ldquo;Unitarianism&rdquo; should be hurled at
Stone and his party. In the eyes of his most bitter
critics, Stone was also a &ldquo;Crypto-Arian&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;Crypto-Socinian.&rdquo; Controversial pamphlets flew
back and forth. As one reads them now, Stone seems
to hold his own in theological scholarship and English
style, and they cast no cloud upon his devotion to
Christ or upon his zeal for the union of Christ&rsquo;s followers
in one family of faith and the salvation of
sinners by the power of the gospel. Stone was anti-Calvinist,
anti-Trinitarian, anticreed, but he was <i>not</i>
a Unitarian.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Likenesses and Differences</span></h3>
<p>Studying Campbell&rsquo;s <i>Christian Baptist</i> and <i>Millennial
Harbinger</i> and Stone&rsquo;s <i>Christian Messenger</i> for
the period shortly before the union of the two movements,
one finds the evidence of some important likenesses
and of certain differences, which were soon adjusted
without much trouble. The likenesses were
these:</p>
<p>1. Both groups consciously and explicitly aimed to
promote the union of Christians.</p>
<p>2. Both rejected creeds and theologies as tests of
fellowship, insisted on liberty of opinion on all matters
of doctrine that were not considered as unmistakably
revealed, and held that simple faith in Christ
was sufficient.</p>
<p>3. They agreed that Christ died for all and that all
could believe on him and be saved.</p>
<p>4. They agreed that saving faith, at least in its
minimum essentials, was nothing else than an act of
the mind in accepting rational evidence of the truth,
and that even fallen and sinful man was capable of
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
that act without special assistance from the Holy
Spirit. This idea was prominent in Campbell&rsquo;s
thought, and it was fundamental in Scott&rsquo;s method,
which gave the Reformers their evangelistic drive.
Stone had expressed the same idea earlier but he did
not make much use of it, and the evangelism of the
Christians does not seem to have been greatly affected
by it.</p>
<p>5. The practice of believers&rsquo; baptism by immersion
and the conception of baptism for the remission of
sins were common to both, subject to some limitations
to be mentioned presently.</p>
<p>6. Both opposed the use of unscriptural names as
sectarian and divisive. On Stone&rsquo;s side there was
much argument that Acts 11:26 (&ldquo;The disciples were
called Christians first in Antioch&rdquo;) meant that they
were so called by divine appointment, so that this
name <i>must</i> be used. But this extreme opinion was not
insisted upon, and Campbell&rsquo;s preference for &ldquo;Disciples&rdquo;
was no obstacle. The use of the two names&mdash;and
of &ldquo;Churches of Christ&rdquo; as well&mdash;confused the
public but was no barrier to union.</p>
<p>Replying to a correspondent who asked why the
Christians should not unite with the &ldquo;New Testament
Baptists&rdquo; (meaning Campbell&rsquo;s Reformers), Stone
wrote in 1828: &ldquo;If there is a difference between us, we
know it not. We have nothing in us to prevent a
union; and if they have nothing in them in opposition
to it, we are in spirit one. May God strengthen the
cords of Christian union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there were some differences of emphasis and
practice. The chief differences were these:</p>
<p>1. The Christians did not make immersion a condition
of membership. Most of them had been immersed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
but they considered baptism as lying in the field of
opinion, in which there should be liberty. Stone repeatedly
defended this position. In 1830 he wrote:
&ldquo;These reforming Baptists are engaged in a good
work. They proclaim union with all who believe the
simple facts of revelation and manifest their faith by
their works of holiness and love, without any regard
to the opinions they may have formed of truth. Should
they make their own peculiar views of immersion a
term of fellowship, it will be impossible for them to
repel successfully the imputation of being sectarians
and of having an authoritative creed (though not
written) of one article at least, which is formed of
their own opinion of truth; and this short creed would
exclude more Christians from union than any creed
with which I am acquainted.&rdquo; Yet only a few months
later he admitted feeling some inconsistency between
preaching immersion for remission of sins and admitting
to church membership without it. &ldquo;When asked
for our divine authority from the New Testament, we
have none that can fully satisfy our own minds. In
this state our minds have labored, and are still laboring.&rdquo;
(<i>Christian Messenger</i>, Vol. IV, pp. 200, 275.)</p>
<p>2. The Christians had at least the beginnings of a
method of obtaining a responsible ministry. Stone
criticized those who thought that a church could &ldquo;induct
into the ministerial office&rdquo;; that function belongs
to the &ldquo;bishops and elders.&rdquo; If a minister is charged
with &ldquo;preaching doctrine contrary to the gospel,&rdquo; he
should be examined by a &ldquo;conference of bishops and
elders.&rdquo; The idea was that the ministry as a whole,
or by conference groups, should have power to protect
the churches against erratic or unworthy ministers.
There is no evidence that such control was actually
exercised, but even the idea of such control was
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
alien to the Disciples until much later, and still is
with most of them. But at the time of the union,
the Christians seem to have had a somewhat &ldquo;higher&rdquo;
conception of the office of the ministry.</p>
<p>3. The Christians were much more zealous in evangelism
than the Reformers had been before the outburst
of evangelistic fervor with John Smith and a
few other &ldquo;New Testament Baptists&rdquo; in Kentucky and
the campaign of Walter Scott in Ohio in 1827. But
their method of evangelism had been of the Methodist
type. There is clear evidence that theirs was, in practice,
a &ldquo;mourners&rsquo; bench&rdquo; revivalism, in spite of
Stone&rsquo;s theory of faith as a rational act. Christian
evangelists, sending to Stone&rsquo;s paper the reports of
their meetings, write that &ldquo;crowds of mourners came
forward weeping and crying for mercy&rdquo;; or, &ldquo;the
preachers had a good measure of the Holy Ghost and
... several [hearers] appeared to be cut to the heart
and were crying for mercy&rdquo;; or, &ldquo;crowds of weeping
mourners came forward to unite with us in prayer&rdquo;;
or, more specifically, that the summer camp meetings
(in Georgia) are &ldquo;conducted in the main in the manner
of Methodist camp meetings.&rdquo; Scott&rsquo;s new method of
presenting the &ldquo;Gospel restored&rdquo; in clear steps
created some surprise and questioning. A Christian
preacher writes: &ldquo;His method and manner are somewhat
novel to me.... He seems to suppose the apostolical
gospel to consist of the use of the following
particulars: faith, repentance, baptism for remission
of sins, the gift of the Holy Spirit, and eternal life.
Thus, you see, he baptizes the subject previous to the
remission of his sins or the receiving of the Holy
Spirit.&rdquo; Stone replies: &ldquo;We have for some time
practiced in this way throughout our country.&rdquo; Evidently
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
Stone had already come to a position identical
with that of Campbell and Scott as to the nature of
faith, the purpose of baptism, and the technique of
evangelism. But just as evidently, the Christian
preachers and churches generally had not. They had
zeal for evangelism, but they still had much to learn
about its method. Scott was their teacher.</p>
<p>4. Whereas the Reformers early adopted the practice
of observing the Lord&rsquo;s Supper every Sunday, the
Christians did not. By 1830, Stone had decided that
this was the practice of the early church, and he
wrote: &ldquo;Whenever the church shall be restored to her
former glory, she will again receive the Lord&rsquo;s Supper
every first day of the week.&rdquo; But he was less
ardent than Campbell about &ldquo;restoring the ancient order
of things,&rdquo; and he was disposed to be patient about
this as he was about immersion.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Union and Growth</span></h3>
<p>By 1830 the Christian churches west of the Alleghenies
had, it is estimated, seven or eight thousand
members in Kentucky, somewhat fewer in Tennessee,
and smaller numbers in all the states to which migrants
had been going from these two. There were district
conferences in Ohio and Indiana, in Alabama and
Mississippi; a Christian church organized in Missouri
in 1816 was only the first of several; and there were
two conferences in Iowa by 1828.</p>
<p>The growing acquaintance and sympathy between
Christians and Disciples led to a number of consultations
between their leaders at various places in Kentucky,
and finally to a meeting at Lexington, January
1, 1832, attended by prominent representatives of both.
It was unanimously agreed that they should unite.
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
Since neither group recognized any church authority
superior to the local congregation, actual union could
be accomplished only by going to the congregations and
persuading them to unite. &ldquo;Raccoon&rdquo; John Smith
(Disciple) and John Rogers (Christian) went out as
a team to carry this message to the churches. Others
took it up. Stone&rsquo;s <i>Christian Messenger</i> and Campbell&rsquo;s
<i>Millennial Harbinger</i> supported it. Within three
years the greater part of the Christian churches in the
area mentioned had joined the merger. On the points
of difference, especially baptism and evangelistic
method, the practice of Campbell and Scott prevailed.
The Christians contributed a revived emphasis upon
liberty of opinion and upon union, which the Reformers
had been in danger of subordinating in their
zeal for the restoration of &ldquo;a particular ecclesiastical
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been, up to this time, no organizational
connection among the three great groups of &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;
churches. Those in New England and those in
the southern Atlantic states were not affected by the
merger with the Disciples. They tightened their denominational
organization and continued their separate
existence until, nearly a hundred years later
(1930), they united with the Congregationalists.</p>
<p>It is not possible to give a clear picture of the numerical
growth and geographical expansion of the
Disciples in their first twenty years. There were at
first no organizations to promote the movement, no
headquarters to project plans, no agencies to collect
statistics, no yearbook to list churches and preachers.
The energy of the movement was tremendous. As
a plea for union, its appeal was to Christians of all
faiths; therefore there was no hesitation about proselyting.
As a presentation of the way of salvation, its
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
message was to the unconverted. Both classes responded
in large numbers. This &ldquo;Gospel restored&rdquo;&mdash;Scott&rsquo;s
five steps in conversion&mdash;and the call to union
on that basis were a simple message. One had only to
hear it to believe it, and almost anyone who believed
it could preach it&mdash;and a great many did. Most of
those who evangelized went out on their own initiative
and responsibility. The frontier was open, and there
was a steady flow of migration to the west. Among
the migrants were many preachers, who were often
farmers also. But if there was no preacher in the
new community, laymen might carry the message and
plant the seed of a church. The distinction between
ministers and laymen was often very vague. One who
could preach became <i>ipso facto</i> a preacher. Besides
farmer-preachers, there were lawyers, doctors, teachers,
and merchants who preached, won converts, baptized
them, and established churches.</p>
<p>The need of some simple and efficient method of
cooperation was soon felt. Some doubted whether any
organization of the churches was scriptural. But the
decision of most was that organized cooperation
among the churches to spread the gospel&mdash;but <i>not</i> to
exercise authority over the churches&mdash;was a proper
expedient. A meeting of representatives of several
churches at New Lisbon, Ohio, in 1831, and another at
Wheeling, West Virginia, in 1835, reached this conclusion
and considered ways and means of cooperation.
A few glimpses, almost at random, at the beginnings
of churches and organizations in certain states
will indicate something of the method and rate of expansion
during these two decades.</p>
<p>In Indiana, several local movements, some beginning
as early as 1810, contributed to the stream of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
Reform. Some Free Will Baptists, regular Baptists,
Dunkers, and &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; had arrived independently
at similar ideas, and presently the <i>Christian Baptist</i>
helped to unify them, and the merging of the Disciples
and Christians completed the process. Their first cooperation
for a specific purpose was when five churches
joined in supporting John O&rsquo;Kane as an evangelist,
and his first work was to organize the First Church
in Indianapolis in 1833. Indiana&rsquo;s first state convention
was held in 1839, with fifty preachers present and
reports of 115 churches with over 7,000 members. The
state missionary society was formed ten years later.
But the growth in numbers and churches&mdash;and it was
rapid and substantial&mdash;was due to the work of individuals,
local churches, and county cooperation more
than to the state organization.</p>
<p>The first Disciples in Illinois came from Kentucky
and Indiana in 1830. Stone visited Jacksonville in
1832, preparatory to moving there two years later.
He found a Christian church and a Disciple church,
and persuaded them to unite. In 1834 a group of
churches in that vicinity voted to employ an evangelist
and issued an invitation to a state meeting. But the
first state meeting was not held until 1842.</p>
<p>To Missouri came the Christian preacher, Thomas
McBride, from Kentucky in 1816, followed soon by
Joel Haden, T. M. Allen, and others. By 1820 there
were eight churches. State meetings began, irregularly,
in 1837. In that year a church was formed in
St. Louis, but it did not persist and was started again
in 1842. Missouri was, from the start, a &ldquo;strong
state&rdquo; for the Disciples.</p>
<p>Texas was still a part of Mexico when Collin McKinney,
a devout &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; layman from Kentucky,
came to the vicinity of Texarkana in 1824 and then
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
moved on to what became Bowie County, where he
spent the rest of a long and active life. He did not
have a church there until a preacher came in 1842; but
when there was a church, McKinney was a pillar of
it, as he was of the republic, and then the state, of
Texas. The first church in Texas was one that came
in a body from Tennessee, with reinforcements from
Alabama and Mississippi, in 1836, and settled at
Clarksville. Lynn D&rsquo;Spain and Mansil W. Matthews
were the preachers who came with this church. David
Crockett accompanied this caravan on part of its journey.
At that time the Mexican constitution prohibited
the exercise of any religion except the Roman Catholic,
but the agencies of enforcement were weak, the seat
of government was far away, and the revolution which
made Texas an independent republic was imminent.</p>
<p>California had two churches, at Stockton and Santa
Clara, within two years after the discovery of gold.
They were established by Thomas Thompson, a Disciple
preacher who went west with the forty-niners
but preferred to evangelize, at his own expense, rather
than to seek gold. This falls just beyond the limits
of our period, the first two decades, but it illustrates
the promptness with which Disciples followed the
frontier. There is a report of a congregation organized
in Oregon Territory in 1846, three years after the
beginning of the &ldquo;great immigration&rdquo; and the very
year in which American title to the territory was
settled by treaty with England.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Campbell at His Zenith</span></h3>
<p>Alexander Campbell&rsquo;s activities during these years
were constant and varied. The <i>Millennial Harbinger</i>
furnished a medium for the development and expression
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
of his ideas and for the exchange of news and
opinions among the churches. His many long tours
for lecturing and preaching were more fruitful in
building morale and gaining publicity for the movement
than in winning converts, for he was never a
very effective evangelist. But from the testimony of
unbiased witnesses, he must have been one of the most
impressive figures that ever stood upon an American
platform. Mrs. Trollope, mother of the English novelist,
and herself the author of <i>Domestic Manners of
the Americans</i>, was present at the debate with Owen
and described Mr. Campbell as &ldquo;the universal admiration
of his audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1836 Mr. Campbell published a volume entitled
<i>The Christian System</i>. This came near to being such
an &ldquo;exhibition of the fullness and precision of the
Holy Scriptures upon the entire subject of Christianity&rdquo;
as Thomas Campbell had suggested in the Postscript
to the <i>Declaration and Address</i>. Those who had
felt the sting of his denunciation of creeds now shouted
with glee that here at last was the &ldquo;Campbellites&rsquo;
creed.&rdquo; But it was not a creed, because it was never
used as a creed and was never intended to be so used.
It was a rather full statement of Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s views
on every religious topic that he considered important.
But no church or organization of churches ever
adopted it. No applicant for membership was ever
asked to accept it. No minister&rsquo;s orthodoxy was ever
tested by it. No one could even be required to read it.
The book itself repudiates the notion of requiring conformity
to this or any other body of doctrine. In it
the author says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The belief of one fact is all that is requisite, as
far as faith goes, to salvation. The belief of this
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
one fact and submission to one institution expressive
of it, is all that is required of Heaven to admission
into the church. The one fact is expressed
in the single proposition, that Jesus the Nazarene
is the Messiah. The one institution is baptism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Christian System</i>, then, was certainly not a creed,
since it declared that only &ldquo;one fact and one institution&rdquo;
were essential.</p>
<p>But when he placed the &ldquo;one institution&rdquo; on a par
with the &ldquo;one fact,&rdquo; Mr. Campbell did not mean to
imply that the unimmersed could not be Christians.
A lady wrote from Lunenburg, Virginia, in 1837, expressing
surprise at some reference he had made to
unimmersed Christians. In reply to this &ldquo;Lunenburg
letter,&rdquo; Mr. Campbell wrote a memorable article for
the <i>Millennial Harbinger</i> and followed it with two
even more emphatic statements answering objections.
In this article, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who is a Christian? I answer, Everyone that
believes in his heart that Jesus of Nazareth is the
Messiah, the Son of God; repents of his sins, and
obeys him in all things according to his measure
of knowledge of his will....</p>
<p>I cannot ... make any one duty the standard
of Christian state or character, not even immersion....</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>It is the image of Christ the Christian looks for
and loves; and this does not consist in being exact
in a few items, but in general devotion to the
whole truth as far as known.</p>
<p>There is no occasion, then, for making immersion,
on a profession of the faith, absolutely essential
to a Christian&mdash;though it may be greatly essential
to his sanctification and comfort.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>In answering an objection to the original article,
Mr. Campbell stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the nice point of opinion on which some
brethren differ, is this: Can a person who simply,
not perversely, <i>mistakes</i> the outward baptism,
have the inward ... which changes his state and
has praise of God, though not of all men?...
To which I answer, that, in my opinion, <i>it is
possible</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1837 Mr. Campbell defended Protestantism in a
debate with the Roman Catholic, Archbishop Purcell,
of Cincinnati. It was a period in which there was
much anti-Catholic agitation, stimulated by what the
Native American party called &ldquo;the rapidly increasing
political influence of the papal power in the United
States&rdquo; and by the violently reactionary policy of the
papacy against every liberal and democratic movement
in Europe. The public and the press had not
yet adopted the hush-hush attitude toward the Catholic
question. Neither of the contestants sought this controversy.
They were virtually forced into it by the
public interest in lectures which both had delivered
before a teachers&rsquo; association in Cincinnati. The
debate was held in Cincinnati. It continued through
eight days and made a great impression on the city.
Mr. Campbell had now defended Protestantism against
the highest Roman Catholic dignitary who ever participated
in such a public discussion in this country,
and he had earlier defended Christianity against one
of the most eminent secularists and skeptics of the
time. These debates were published and widely circulated.</p>
<p>But for the exposition and defense of his own movement,
the high point in Campbell&rsquo;s career as a debater
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
was his debate with the Presbyterian minister, N. L.
Rice, at Lexington, Kentucky, in 1843. Henry Clay
served as moderator. The debate lasted for eighteen
days. Four of the six propositions had to do with
baptism. Campbell affirmed that the act is immersion
and the purpose is the remission of past sins. Rice
affirmed that the infant of a believing parent is a
proper subject, and that baptism may be administered
only by a bishop or ordained presbyter. In the other
two propositions, Campbell affirmed that the Holy
Spirit operates only through the Word in conversion
and sanctification, and that creeds are necessarily
&ldquo;heretical and schismatical.&rdquo; This debate, published
in a thick volume of more than 900 closely printed
pages, became a book of reference for generations of
Disciples and perhaps did as much as any other one
thing to standardize their thinking and practice.</p>
<p>The duty of founding colleges for the education of
ministers, the building of an intelligent laity, and the
Christian culture of society was suggested almost as
soon as the Disciples realized that they were a separate
body committed to a long-term enterprise. A charter
was obtained in 1833 for a college at New Albany,
Indiana, but nothing came of it. The first actual college
of the Disciples was Bacon College, founded at
Georgetown, Kentucky, in 1836. The name was
selected to honor Francis Bacon and to register approval
of his empirical philosophy. Walter Scott was
its first president, but he did little beyond delivering
an inaugural address, and within less than a year he
was succeeded by D. S. Burnet. The school was moved
to Harrodsburg in 1839, was discontinued in 1850, was
revived as Kentucky University, and in 1865 was
moved to Lexington, where it acquired the property
and historic tradition of Transylvania University.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Bethany College was incorporated in 1840 and
opened soon after. Mr. Campbell projected and organized
it, gave the land which became its beautiful
campus, raised the money for its building and maintenance,
and served as its president for more than
twenty years. His writings on education, especially
the series of articles in the <i>Millennial Harbinger</i> during
the year when he was making his plans for Bethany,
prove that he was an original and creative thinker
in the field of both general and Christian education.
His expectations as to the service his college would
render to the movement as a whole were amply realized.
It became for a time the principal training
school for ministers and the educational center for
the laity; and it was the &ldquo;mother of colleges&rdquo; among
the Disciples.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="large">ORGANIZATION AND TENSIONS, 1849-74</span></h2>
<p>As the Disciples grew and spread, the need of
organization on a national scale was felt. There
were still lingering doubts as to whether fidelity to
the &ldquo;ancient order of things&rdquo; permitted such organization.
But the prevailing decision was that meetings
of &ldquo;deputies, messengers or representatives&rdquo; of the
churches might properly be held if they would remember
that they are &ldquo;voluntary expedients&rdquo; and &ldquo;have
no authority to legislate in any matter of faith or
moral duty&rdquo; but exist only &ldquo;to attend to the ways and
means of successful cooperation.&rdquo; These words,
quoted from a resolution adopted by a conference on
cooperation held at Steubenville, Ohio, in 1844, express
the policy that became permanent.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell himself, laying aside any earlier
prejudice against what he had called &ldquo;popular
schemes&rdquo; among the denominations, urged &ldquo;a more
general and efficient cooperation in the Bible cause, in
the missionary cause, in the educational cause.&rdquo; But
so long as the Disciples had no agency of their own for
foreign missionary work he recommended (1845) that
they support the Baptist Missionary Society. And
when, in the same year, D. S. Burnet and other brethren
in Cincinnati organized an &ldquo;American Christian
Bible Society,&rdquo; he felt that this action was premature,
that it was not sufficiently representative of the whole
brotherhood, and that more could be accomplished
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
with the available funds by contributing them to the
(Baptist) American and Foreign Bible Society. He
was no isolationist, and he bore no grudge against the
Baptists, in spite of the acrimonies that had accompanied
the expulsion of the Reformers from Baptist
churches and associations a few years earlier. He also
endorsed the Evangelical Alliance as soon as it was
formed in 1846.</p>
<p>The demand for a national convention that would
represent the whole body of Disciples found voice
through most of the influential journals. All who
urged a convention spoke of it as a meeting of &ldquo;delegates&rdquo;
appointed by the churches. To those who still
objected that conventions and missionary societies
were no part of the &ldquo;ancient order,&rdquo; Mr. Campbell
replied that in such matters of method and procedure
the church is &ldquo;left free and unshackled by any apostolic
authority.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">National Organization</span></h3>
<p>The first national convention of Disciples met at
Cincinnati, October 24-28, 1849, with 156 representatives
from one hundred churches in eleven states.
Some came as delegates with credentials from their
churches. Others represented districts. The Indiana
state meeting had elected messengers. But many ministers
and active laymen were present who had no
formal appointment and no credentials. Since these
were well-known brethren, whose standing as representative
Disciples no one could deny, and whose right
to an equal status with the elected delegates it would
have been embarrassing to challenge, it was voted
to enroll all present as members of the convention. So
this first national convention, though projected as a
delegate convention, became a mass meeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>The organization of a missionary society was the
principal business of the convention. The name first
chosen was &ldquo;Home and Foreign Missionary Society,&rdquo;
but this was immediately changed to &ldquo;American Christian
Missionary Society,&rdquo; because &ldquo;the missionary
cause is one&rdquo;&mdash;a truth that was rediscovered in 1919.
The society&rsquo;s name meant that it was to be an American
agency for missions throughout the world, including
America. Alexander Campbell was elected
its first president, and he was re-elected annually as
long as he lived.</p>
<p>No sooner had the convention been held and the
society formed than the opposition to both flared up
again. Jacob Creath, Jr., who had been opposed to the
convention from the beginning, wanted to have another
convention to discuss the legitimacy of conventions
and societies. Some others argued that &ldquo;the
church is the only missionary society and can admit no
rivals&rdquo;; but these also objected to any arrangement
for united action by the churches, so that, in their
view, each congregation would have to be a separate
missionary society. The criticism of conventions and
societies on the ground that there was no New Testament
command or precedent for them did not seem to
have much popular support at this time, and it soon
died down. But a few years later it became a highly
controversial issue, and finally a divisive one.</p>
<p>The first venture abroad was the Jerusalem mission,
led by Dr. James T. Barclay. Even before the convention
met and before the society was formed, Dr. Barclay
had been pressing the cause of foreign missions
upon the Disciples, had suggested Jerusalem as a field,
and had offered his services. He was a man of fine
culture, with a college degree from the University of
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
Virginia and a degree in medicine from the University
of Pennsylvania, and the depth of his piety equaled
the ardor of his devotion to the cause. The selection
of Jerusalem as the scene of the first foreign missionary
effort was based chiefly on sentimental considerations.
Since the gospel had first been preached &ldquo;beginning
at Jerusalem,&rdquo; it seemed fitting that the
world-wide proclamation of the &ldquo;gospel restored&rdquo;
should also begin there. Dr. Barclay and his family
reached Jerusalem in February, 1851. After three and
a half years of work, not entirely unfruitful but on the
whole disappointing, he returned with the report that
conditions did not warrant the continuance of the
mission at that time.</p>
<p>Soon after, the society attempted to plant a mission
among the Negro freedmen who had migrated to
Liberia. This colony on the west coast of Africa had
but recently declared its independence, which had been
recognized by most of the powers&mdash;except the United
States. A Negro slave, Alexander Cross, was bought,
freed, educated, and sent to evangelize among his own
people; but he died of fever on the coast of Liberia
before he could begin his work. In 1858 J. O. Beardslee,
who had been a missionary in Jamaica with another
communion, became a Disciple and returned to
that island under the auspices of the American Christian
Missionary Society. His work produced no
notable results, but it may have helped to open the
fray for the more substantial work in Jamaica some
years later. These three&mdash;Jerusalem, Liberia, and
Jamaica&mdash;were the only foreign missionary efforts in
the twenty-five years during which the society undertook
to conduct both foreign and home missions, and
all three were counted as failures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Growth, Journalism, Education</span></h3>
<p>During the quarter-century to which our attention
is now directed, the American Christian Missionary
Society did something toward sending evangelists to
neglected areas and planting churches on the frontier.
State societies did more. But the work that produced
the very substantial growth in this period was done
chiefly by churches and evangelists acting independently,
by county and neighborhood cooperation, and
by individuals who were following the westward tide
of migration. While churches were being established
in the new Western territories and states as fast as
population flowed into them, there was also a steady
increase of membership in the Central states, where
the movement had had its beginnings. After a tour of
Indiana in 1850, Mr. Campbell reported that &ldquo;our
people&rdquo; in that state were second only to the Methodists
in numbers, resources, and influence. Their
standing in Kentucky at that time was certainly no
worse. Development east of the Alleghenies was relatively
slow and slight, except in Virginia and North
Carolina, where early visits and preaching by Disciple
ministers had proved fruitful. These two states would
have been even stronger if they had not lost, while the
Western states were gaining, by the westward current
of migration. In other Eastern states there were some
notable old churches, some of which originated under
Haldanean, Sandemanian, or similar influences and became
affiliated with the Disciples, but they did not
greatly multiply.</p>
<p>The total numerical growth from 1849 to 1874 was
not merely substantial; it was amazing. By the middle
of the nineteenth century, after twenty years of
separate existence, the Disciples had about 118,000
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
members. In the 1850-60 decade their numbers were
almost doubled to 225,000. For 1870, the figure is
given as 350,000. By 1875 it was probably close to
400,000. This growth is the more remarkable because
it was accomplished with very little help from promotional
organizations and with very little general
planning.</p>
<p>The abundance and vigor of the periodicals devoted
to the defense of the faith and the dissemination of
news of the churches did much to make up for the lack
of more official agencies of cooperation. The editors
had no authority, but they exercised wide influence in
the spread of ideas and the promotion of acquaintance
among the Disciples in scattered communities. James
M. Mathes published the <i>Christian Record</i> at various
places in Indiana, with some intermissions, from 1843
to 1884. By far the most influential editor, aside from
Campbell and Errett, was Benjamin Franklin, a collateral
relative of the famous Dr. Benj. Franklin.</p>
<p>Our Ben Franklin began his long and notable editorial
career in 1845 with a paper which, beginning as
the <i>Reformer</i> and passing through several changes and
mergers, became the <i>American Christian Review</i>. He
was a powerful supporter of the missionary society until,
after serving as its secretary for a short time, he
turned against it and became the most effective opponent
of organized work. More important than this
was the sledge-hammer evangelism that he carried on
incessantly, with the spoken as well as the written
word. Completely without formal education, he developed
a clear and trenchant style which does not
need his biographer&rsquo;s apologies. The favorite theme
of his writing, and the sole theme of his preaching, was
the &ldquo;plan of salvation&rdquo; and the plea of the Disciples
for that simple gospel and the restoration of the church
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
on the apostolic pattern. A volume of his evangelistic
sermons, <i>The Gospel Preacher</i>, was the handbook for
hundreds of other preachers and kept its popularity
for half a century. One must know Ben Franklin,
and realize how many there were like him, though
built to a smaller scale, to understand how the Disciples
grew so fast in this pioneer period&mdash;and why
they ran into some difficulties later. Franklin also
helped to save the Disciples from division over slavery
and the Civil War by urging that the sole business of
the church is to preach the gospel. In doing this, he
also helped to fasten upon them the idea that the
church must be neutral on all social and economic
questions. A Christian &ldquo;should make his money according
to the laws of business and spend it according
to the laws of God,&rdquo; said one eminent minister.</p>
<p>About 1850 there arose a great zeal for founding
colleges. In several states the Disciples had become
strong enough, or felt sure that they soon would be
strong enough, to support a college. Schools were
needed to train ministers, to provide an educated laity,
to hold the loyalty of the young people of their own
families and win others, and to make their fair contribution
to the culture of new communities in which
there was little provision for tax-supported education.</p>
<p>In 1845 the Disciples had three colleges: Bacon, at
Harrodsburg, Kentucky; Bethany, at what is now
Bethany, West Virginia; and Franklin, near Nashville,
Tennessee. Within a year or two before or after
1850, at least nine colleges and institutes were established,
most of which still live. These included: Kentucky
Female Orphan School, Midway, Kentucky;
Western Reserve Eclectic Institute, which became
Hiram College, Hiram, Ohio; Northwestern Christian
University, which became Butler University, Indianapolis,
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
Indiana; Walnut Grove Academy, which grew
into Eureka College, Eureka, Illinois; Christian College
(for girls), Columbia, Missouri; Abington College,
Abington, Illinois, which later merged with Eureka;
Berea College, Jacksonville, Illinois, which died young;
Arkansas College, Fayetteville, Arkansas, which met
the same fate; and Oskaloosa College, Oskaloosa, Iowa,
which had thirty useful years before it was dimmed
by the brighter light of Drake University.</p>
<p>The percentage of survival in this list is unusually
high. It was much lower among the colleges started
during the next twenty or thirty years. The cost of
maintaining a good college, according to the standards
of that time, was very little in comparison with
present needs, but it was more than most of the eager
college founders thought it would be. Many schools
were started which had not a sufficient constituency.
Others were brought forth by the local pride of an
optimistic young settlement and withered away when
its hope was deferred or its boom collapsed&mdash;for while
Chicago and Kansas City grew miraculously, many a
&ldquo;future metropolis&rdquo; of the Middle West remained
a village. Few of the new colleges were adequately
financed, even for a modest beginning. The mortality
rate was therefore high. The Disciples were not alone
in this. Other denominations lost many infant colleges.
By 1865 there was a general complaint about
the reckless multiplication of weak colleges. Moses E.
Lard expressed the mind of many when he wrote:
&ldquo;We are building ten where we should have but one.
One great university, with a single well-endowed college
in each state where we number fifty thousand, is
sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One is rather surprised to find, running through
several issues of the <i>Millennial Harbinger</i> in that same
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
year, a discussion as to whether the Disciples needed a
good theological school for the graduate training of
the ministry. W. K. Pendleton, Campbell&rsquo;s son-in-law
(twice) and his successor as president of Bethany College
and as editor of the <i>Millennial Harbinger</i>, argued
that there was need of a school to give ministers a
professional education beyond what the colleges can
or should furnish. Isaac Errett agreed with Pendleton.
Ben Franklin, naturally, opposed. Nothing was
done. For another thirty or forty years the Disciples
continued to consider training for the ministry as a
phase of undergraduate education.</p>
<h3 class="generic">&ldquo;<span class="sc">We Can Never Divide</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Through these years the slavery issue was mounting
to the crisis of war. All the churches were deeply
stirred. Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians
divided. Congregationalists, being practically all in
the North and therefore all on the same side of the
question, did not divide. The Episcopal Church peaceably
divided when the country was divided by secession,
and as peaceably reunited when the country
was reunited. Disciples were nearly equal in numbers,
North and South. They might easily have divided, but
they did not.</p>
<p>Alexander Campbell&rsquo;s sentiments were against
slavery and he was never a slaveholder, but he lived
in a slave state and had little sympathy with radical
abolitionism. Much of the patronage and financial
support of Bethany College came from the South, and
he tried to keep the college neutral on these controversial
issues. The first graduating class of Northwestern
Christian University (Butler) was made up
of a group of students who withdrew from Bethany in
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
sympathy with a young man who had been expelled for
making an antislavery speech after the public discussion
of that question in the college had been forbidden.
Campbell had elaborated his position in a series of
articles in 1845: slavery is not condemned in the New
Testament; therefore holding slaves is not sinful
<i>per se</i> and cannot be a ground for withdrawing Christian
fellowship; masters must do their full Christian
duty toward their slaves, though it is admittedly very
difficult to maintain a fully Christian attitude toward
a person while owning him as a slave; slavery is economically
bad and morally dangerous; and the policy
to be followed in any situation is a matter of
&ldquo;opinion&rdquo; and therefore within the area of Christian
liberty.</p>
<p>That useful distinction between faith and opinion,
which was fundamental to the Disciples&rsquo; program for
union, now saved them from division over slavery and
war. All political and social questions were to be
treated as matters of opinion on which Christians
might differ without dividing. Fourteen ministers in
Missouri, including J. W. McGarvey, published in
1861 a &ldquo;pacifist manifesto&rdquo; urging Disciples to take
no part in the war. They did not argue that war is always
wrong or anti-Christian, nor did they discuss any
moral issue of the war that was then beginning. Their
whole point was that &ldquo;our movement&rdquo; would suffer
disastrously if its members were to take arms against
each other. Few Disciples were guided by their advice.
Most of them, North and South, apparently felt
that their attitudes in a great national crisis could not
be determined by the consideration of what might
happen to &ldquo;our movement&rdquo;&mdash;or else they thought that
the movement could stand it, as it did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The first national convention after the outbreak of
war, meeting at Cincinnati in October, 1861, took a
ten-minute recess so that its members, not as the convention
but as a mass meeting, might pass a resolution
of loyalty to the national government. Two years
later the convention itself adopted a stronger resolution
deploring the &ldquo;attempts of armed traitors to overthrow
our government.&rdquo; But even this produced no
division. It was a Northern convention because, under
war conditions, there could, of course, be no representation
from the South. Southerners realized that
the resolution was merely an expression of Northern
opinion, which they already knew; and many Northerners
soon came to feel that it was a mistake for a
sectional convention bearing a national name to pass
a resolution purporting to express the sentiments of
all Disciples, including the half of the country which
could not possibly be represented. The organizational
weakness of the Disciples became a strength in maintaining
unity when the slavery issue and civil war
threatened division, for there was no court to rule out
any church or section and no convention empowered
to set up standards or to pass any resolution that
would have the force of law for the churches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can never divide!&rdquo; shouted Moses E. Lard in
his quarterly. If war could not divide us, he said,
nothing ever can. But something could&mdash;and did.
Disciples cannot divide through the exclusion of one
element by another in control of denominational
machinery, because there is no such machinery with
power of exclusion. But it is possible to divide by
voluntary withdrawal. If there is no power to put
any church out, there is none to keep it in if it wants
to go out. That is what happened some years later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">The Period of Controversy</span></h3>
<p>The issues upon which division actually occurred
had already arisen before the Civil War and they were
so hotly debated in the years immediately after it
that 1866-75 is sometimes called &ldquo;the period of controversy.&rdquo;
The principal topics which were discussed
with greater or less heat during this period were
these: open or close communion; the title, &ldquo;Reverend&rdquo;;
the &ldquo;one-man system&rdquo; of the pastorate; the
alleged introduction of a creed; the use of the organ;
and the missionary societies. Only the last two of
these had any lasting importance as divisive issues.
The first four merely illustrate the heightening tension
between the strict constructionists and those who
favored what they considered reasonable expedients
to meet changed conditions.</p>
<p>When the Reformers were being excluded from Baptist
churches and associations, they were accused of
many things but not of departing from the Baptist
practice of close communion. One must conclude that
they had not yet departed from it. In 1828 Mr. Campbell
objected to admitting the unimmersed to the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper even occasionally, because he thought
this would logically require admitting them to church
membership. But the restriction upon the communion
was gradually relaxed, without much talk about it,
until Isaac Errett could write in 1862, when the question
was debated at length in the <i>Millennial Harbinger</i>,
that probably two-thirds of the churches welcomed
to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper all who considered themselves
qualified to commune. The solving text was that
each should &ldquo;examine himself and so let him eat,&rdquo; and
the standard formula came to be, &ldquo;We neither invite
nor debar.&rdquo; There was, in fact, very little general
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
controversy on this subject. In time the close communion
practice disappeared so completely that most
Disciples in the United States do not know that it
ever existed and are somewhat shocked to learn that
it still prevails in the British churches.</p>
<p>The presentation to Mr. Errett of a silver door plate
with &ldquo;Reverend&rdquo; before his name precipitated a brief
but lively argument. Aversion to this title had been
common among the earlier restorers of primitive Christianity.
The <i>Christian Baptist</i> had said many a
caustic word about clerical pretensions of dignity
and usurpations of power, of which &ldquo;Reverend&rdquo; was
considered a symbol. But as Disciples came to have
more and larger churches and a ministry more clearly
distinguished from the laity, they became less sensitive
about a title which, in practice, meant only that its
bearer was a minister. The title long remained unpopular,
but the issue faded out.</p>
<p>Protest against the &ldquo;one-man system&rdquo; had a similar
motive but more substantial ground. The enlarging
function of the pastor and the somewhat diminished
prominence of the lay elders, as town and city churches
with settled full-time ministers multiplied, evoked a
futile resistance to the passing of those frontier conditions
under which lay leadership for the churches had
been successful. &ldquo;Mutual edification&rdquo; had been considered
by many to be an essential part of the ancient
order. No division came from this difference in practice
and terminology, and the difference itself tended
to disappear. One of the ultraconservatives gave the
reason when he wrote: &ldquo;Brethren, no system of
edification can be scriptural if it doesn&rsquo;t edify.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mr. Errett, as minister of a new church in
Detroit, issued for public information a brief &ldquo;Synopsis&rdquo;
of the Disciples&rsquo; position, there was an outcry
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
against it as a &ldquo;creed.&rdquo; Strangely enough, the chief
critic, Moses E. Lard, had himself put forth &ldquo;sixteen
specifications of fundamental principles.&rdquo; This episode
is worth noting only because it shows how keen
the legalists were to find proofs that the Disciples had
become degenerate and had gone off after &ldquo;innovations.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Not Divided&mdash;Yet</span></h3>
<p>The organ question, unlike the four issues that have
been mentioned, cut deep, lasted long, and contributed
to division. Protestant opposition to instrumental
music in public worship began with Zwingli and Calvin
(who were also strict restorers of primitive Christianity)
and reappeared among New England Congregational
churches in the eighteenth century. It did
not become important among the Disciples before 1860,
because there were few organs. About that time, L. L.
Pinkerton said that he was the only preacher in Kentucky
who favored the use of the organ and that his
church at Midway was the only church that had one.
The organ in public worship was, in truth, an &ldquo;innovation.&rdquo;
The case against it was completely stated by J.
W. McGarvey in the <i>Millennial Harbinger</i> for November,
1864: The organ is not merely an aid to singing,
like hymnbooks or a tuning fork, or a convenient accessory
to the church building, like a stove, but is a distinct
and novel element in worship; no element in
public worship is legitimate unless it is explicitly authorized
in the New Testament; instrumental music is
not so authorized; therefore it is not legitimate. The
crucial question was whether the New Testament does,
as he claims, undertake to specify all the permissible
elements of public worship. And the answer to that
question is part of the answer to the larger question
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
as to what is to be restored in the restoration of primitive
Christianity. Back of that lies the still more basic
question as to the nature of the New Testament.
Churches did not disfellowship each other over the organ
question, but many congregations divided on it.</p>
<p>The most serious of all the controversies was about
the missionary societies, national and state. Those who
sought in the primitive church a model for all the procedures
of the church, as well as a blueprint for its
structure, found no justification for societies. There
had been some protests when district and state meetings
were first proposed and more when the national
convention and missionary society were organized.
This opposition had waned, but it was revived in the
1860&rsquo;s with new vigor and new journalistic champions.
The war, the loyalty resolutions, acrimony over the
organ, the failure of the society&rsquo;s three foreign missions,
and the widening social and economic gap between
the plain people of the country churches and the
more sophisticated townsfolk&mdash;these all helped to
bring in an era of ill will. Cultural isolation and the
lack of educated leaders in this middle period favored
the tendency toward a narrow legalism. The death of
Alexander Campbell on March 4, 1866, after he had
been president of the American Christian Missionary
Society for more than sixteen years, made it possible
for its opponents to dig up and reprint under his name
the antisociety fulminations of the <i>Christian Baptist</i>
forty years earlier. Almost at the same time Benjamin
Franklin turned against the society and made
his <i>American Christian Review</i> a powerful weapon
of attack. The main onslaught was not against the
management of the society but against the idea of
having any society at all. However, all these hostile
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
influences were the more damaging because the
A.C.M.S. was not, in fact, doing much work.</p>
<p>To satisfy the critics and prevent the threatened
disruption, a completely new plan of cooperation was
devised by a committee of twenty, including both society
and antisociety men. The product of its labors
was the &ldquo;Louisville Plan,&rdquo; which was adopted almost
unanimously by the convention of 1869. Under this
plan the A.C.M.S. ceased to function. Its place was
taken by a system of general, state, and district conventions,
with boards, secretaries, and treasurers
springing from and reporting to the three levels of
conventions. In theory, it was a closely knit fabric of
delegate conventions, the General Convention being
composed of delegates from the state conventions,
these of delegates from district conventions, and the
district conventions of messengers elected by the
churches. The wonder is that the antisociety men accepted
it for a moment as (Ben Franklin&rsquo;s words) &ldquo;a
simple and scriptural plan.&rdquo; They did not accept it
long, and even the friends of the society were cool to
it. &ldquo;Scriptural&rdquo; or not, it was incredibly cumbersome
and impractical. Receipts for national missionary
work fell off from about $10,000 to an average of less
than $4,000 a year for the next decade. Missionary
cooperation had to take a fresh start; and so it did with
the beginning of the next period.</p>
<p>It was largely due to Isaac Errett and the <i>Christian
Standard</i> that the Disciples did not become a
legalistic and exclusive sect. The paper was founded
at Cleveland in 1866&mdash;its first issue carried the news
of Alexander Campbell&rsquo;s death&mdash;and it was moved to
Cincinnati in 1869. Errett was already a man of
power and distinction. He had been pastor, author,
co-editor of the <i>Millennial Harbinger</i>, corresponding
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
secretary of the American Christian Missionary Society,
and president of the convention. In starting
the <i>Christian Standard</i> he had the active support of
General Garfield and three of the Phillips brothers of
Newcastle, Pennsylvania. The new journal at once
threw its influence boldly on the liberal side of all the
controversial issues that have been mentioned. The
<i>Gospel Advocate</i> already was, and the <i>American Christian
Review</i> was soon to be, arrayed against all &ldquo;innovations.&rdquo;
To complicate the picture, the <i>Apostolic
Times</i> was established with an impressive list of
editors&mdash;Lard, Graham, Hopson, Wilkes, and McGarvey&mdash;who
aimed to heal the incipient division by taking
what they considered a middle-of-the-road position,
against the organ but for the missionary society.</p>
<p>The service of Isaac Errett would have been less
significant than it was if it had been only the championing
of the progressive side in certain controversies.
What was more important was the breadth of his
spirit, the depth of his religious life, and the power
of his leadership away from a cramping legalism and
toward a broader spiritual culture. In an article
entitled &ldquo;What Is Sectarianism?&rdquo; in the <i>Christian
Quarterly</i>, January, 1871, Mr. Errett restated the aim
of the Disciples of Christ as union upon Christ, not
upon our own interpretation of the Bible or on an exact
pattern of the &ldquo;ancient order of things.&rdquo; J. J.
Haley later called this article &ldquo;the Declaration and
Address brought down to date.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="large">RENAISSANCE, 1874-1909</span></h2>
<p>After the dark ages of controversy and organizational
stagnation&mdash;which were by no means so
dark in other respects&mdash;came a renaissance in which
the Disciples gained a clearer view of their central
purpose and a better command of the resources for
realizing it. They began to make more intimate contacts
with the social and intellectual currents of the
time and to escape from the cultural isolation into
which they had fallen. Those who thought of this as
apostasy from the true faith tended to withdraw, and
ultimately did withdraw, into a separate and noncooperating
group. The main body no longer took interest
in what now seemed trivial disputes about organs,
pastors, and the legitimacy of missionary organizations.
The new issues which arose were such as
were shared by the whole Christian world, so that even
their dissensions related them to the main currents of
religious thought.</p>
<p>This period saw the continuance of westward expansion,
the winning of a second and almost a third half-million
members, the creation of new missionary and
benevolent organizations, more than a hundredfold increase
in giving for missions, new journalistic enterprises,
an educational awakening, a new type of evangelism,
new outreaches in Christian union and interdenominational
cooperation, and some slight beginning
of a discovery of social ethics as a field of Christian
responsibility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The &ldquo;dark ages&rdquo; had not been stagnant in numerical
and geographical growth. That process needed
only to be continued. As the completion of the transcontinental
railroads brought new land within reach
for settlement, and as homesteaders invaded what had
been the open range, towns sprang up throughout the
West. In town and country, Disciples were there
among the first, and churches were planted. After the
American Christian Missionary Society was relieved
of its foreign responsibilities, it could do more in promoting
new work in the West. Soon the Board of
Church Extension came to give first aid to the new
church needing a house. It was never a log-cabin
frontier west of the Mississippi (except Missouri and
Arkansas), and building was a different problem from
what it had been on the old timbered frontier. Even
though the Disciples could draw less support from the
East than some denominations, they became relatively
strong in most of the Western states and very strong
in some, such as Kansas and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Total estimated membership in 1875 was 400,000.
The official figure was 641,000 for 1890; 1,120,000 for
1900; 1,363,533 for 1910.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Journalism and Missions</span></h3>
<p>A new center of journalistic influence began when
J. H. Garrison moved his paper, the <i>Christian</i>, from
Quincy, Illinois, to St. Louis, on January 1, 1874, and
organized the Christian Publishing Company. He had
been on the point of moving it to Chicago, when the
Great Fire of 1871 intervened. B. W. Johnson&rsquo;s
<i>Evangelist</i>, which had lately moved from Iowa to
Chicago, merged with the <i>Christian</i> in 1882 to produce
the <i>Christian-Evangelist</i>. By its conservatively progressive
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
policy, it became at once a powerful force in
leading the Disciples out of the age of sterile controversy
and into a wider conception of religion and
more active work in its promotion. The <i>Christian
Standard</i>, at Cincinnati, under Isaac Errett, was already
exercising a similar influence. As long as Mr.
Errett lived, the two papers worked together for the
same ends. The relations between these two great editors
were always intimate and affectionate. Writing
from his deathbed (1888) to his brother editor, J. H.
Garrison, who was his junior by twenty-two years, Mr.
Errett said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have been together from the beginning of
this missionary work. We have stood shoulder to
shoulder ... and the two most effective instrumentalities
in educating our people and bringing
them into active cooperation in spreading the
gospel in all lands have been the <i>Christian-Evangelist</i>
and the <i>Christian Standard</i>; and indeed,
upon all points of doctrine and practice and
expediency you and I have always worked on the
same lines in perfect harmony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A third paper, destined to hold a very prominent
place in American journalism at a later date, was plodding
its useful way through most of this period with a
rather local constituency. This was the <i>Christian
Oracle</i>, which began at Des Moines in 1884 and later
moved to Chicago. In 1900 it became the <i>Christian
Century</i>. For several years thereafter it reflected the
liberal spirit of Herbert L. Willett, who was its editor
for a time. Coming under the control and editorship
of Charles Clayton Morrison in 1908, it soon began
to evolve into an undenominational journal of religion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>The real awakening of the Disciples came with the
rise of their interest in missions. Legalistic controversy
over missionary methods had previously absorbed
so much energy that little was left for missionary
work. The old society had barely kept itself
alive. The Louisville Plan had been a total failure.
Into this vacuum came a band of devoted women, led
by Mrs. C. N. Pearre, of Iowa City, who formed the
Christian Woman&rsquo;s Board of Missions in 1874. The
organizing ability and untiring energy that went into
it would have made almost any enterprise a success.
The regular meetings of the local auxiliaries and of
Junior and Intermediate groups and the publication
of the monthly <i>Missionary Tidings</i> and other literature
constituted a vast program of missionary education.
A system of regular dues produced a trickle of
dimes which aggregated a torrent of dollars. By 1909
there were 60,000 adult members. Offerings up to that
time had totaled nearly $2,500,000. Missions were conducted
in Jamaica, India, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Argentina,
and Liberia. There were schools in the backward
Appalachian Mountain area, institutes and missions
for Orientals on the West Coast, evangelists in
thirty-three states, a missionary training school at
Indianapolis, and &ldquo;Bible chairs&rdquo; at the Universities
of Michigan, Virginia, Kansas, and Texas.</p>
<p>In 1875, almost with the founding of the women&rsquo;s
work, came the organization of the Foreign Christian
Missionary Society. Its early development was slow,
and it was ten years before it had an office of its own
or a full-time secretary. By 1881 its annual income
had risen to $13,178. It was still sending the gospel
only to Christians. It had missions in Denmark, England,
France, and among the Armenians in Turkey,
and was planning to send (but did not send) missionaries
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
to Italy and Germany. An address by J. H.
Garrison, at the convention at Louisville in 1881, appealing
for missions to the heathen, led immediately
to the establishment of Children&rsquo;s Day for that purpose.
The foreign missionary deadlock was at last
broken. Receipts of the foreign society doubled the
next year, and G. L. Wharton and seven others were
sent to India. Japan was entered in 1883, China in
1886, the Belgian Congo in 1897, Cuba in 1899. A.
McLean was an invaluable missionary leader for many
years, and an unforgettable personality.</p>
<p>When the American Society was permitted to devote
itself wholly to American missions, its energies
revived and it had an important part in the expansion
that has been mentioned, as well as on the new frontier
of foreign populations in the cities. In addition, it
sponsored the Board of Church Extension, which at
first made only small building loans to new and weak
churches but later, as its resources increased, was able
also to help some important city churches with their
housing problems. George W. Muckley, as representative
of Church Extension for nearly forty years, from
1888, linked his name inseparably with this cause.</p>
<p>The National Benevolent Association, 1887, grew
out of a purely local impulse in St. Louis, but its work
expanded from a single orphans&rsquo; home in that city to
a long list of institutions for children and old people
in all parts of the country. This and the Board of
Ministerial Relief showed that the Disciples were
awakening to social responsibilities of which they had
not previously taken account on a national scale.
Ministerial &ldquo;relief&rdquo; was found to be inadequate, but
it prepared the way for the more businesslike Pension
Fund.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Renaissance in Education</span></h3>
<p>At the beginning of this period a new birth in education
was as badly needed as in organization and
missions. It came, but not as promptly. The colleges
had been founded largely as training schools for ministers,
and they performed that function better than
any other. From the Civil War to the end of the century
they were poorly equipped, meagerly supported,
and inadequately staffed. Since there were few high
schools outside the cities, and the Disciples were 93
per cent rural in 1890, entrance requirements and academic
standards were necessarily low. The young
preacher who had finished the ministerial course in
one of these colleges was supposed to have completed
his professional education.</p>
<p>The educational awakening included three things:
First, a few men in the 1890&rsquo;s, then scores and hundreds,
went to the divinity schools and graduate departments
of the great universities for further training
after they had been graduated from the colleges of
the Disciples. Second, these colleges themselves
gained greater resources, raised their standards, and
many of them became excellent institutions. Third,
with well-trained men now available for faculties,
there arose some graduate schools of sound quality in
connection with a few of the Disciples&rsquo; colleges. This
advance proceeded slowly and on an uneven front.
Some colleges became better than others, and some
became better sooner. Some died because they could
not meet the more rigorous demands of the modern
age, including those of the standardizing and accrediting
agencies; and some with small resources and low
academic standards continued to render valuable service
in educationally retarded areas. Most of the improvement
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
in the colleges came after the beginning of
the twentieth century. In 1897 there were forty-five
educational institutions, including five &ldquo;universities&rdquo;
and twenty-five colleges; and the total of their endowments
was $1,177,000. Six years later this amount
had been doubled. Thirty years after that, these
doubled endowments had been multiplied by ten&mdash;and
seventeen of the forty-five schools had disappeared.</p>
<p>The establishment of the first &ldquo;Bible chair&rdquo; at the
University of Michigan by the Christian Woman&rsquo;s
Board of Missions was a piece of educational pioneering
which led to great developments and became the
Disciples&rsquo; most original contribution to American education.
There was a touch of genius in the discovery
of the obvious fact, hitherto apparently unnoticed,
that the students in state universities, which were
growing enormously, offered a constituency for religious
education, and the further fact that there were
more young Disciples in state schools than in their
own colleges. Bible chairs were established at many
other state universities, some under the auspices of
state missionary societies, others under independent
boards. Some developed into schools of religion in
which several denominations cooperated. The one at
the University of Virginia became an integral part of
the university. The whole development showed that
the education of the future lay leaders did not rest
wholly with the Disciples&rsquo; colleges, indispensable as
these were, but could be promoted by using also state
or other endowed institutions.</p>
<p>Similarly, the education of the ministry gained
vastly by utilizing universities and theological seminaries
maintained by others. Before 1909 there was
already a beaten trail from some of the colleges to
Yale Divinity School, and the numbers who traveled
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
it later ran into the hundreds. Many went to Union
Theological Seminary in New York, and others to
Harvard, Princeton, Hartford, or Vanderbilt. The
University of Chicago, which opened its doors in 1892,
furnished a seat of learning in the Middle West and
therefore nearer to the geographical center of the Disciples.
Though its divinity school was at first nominally
Baptist, it appealed definitely to students of all
denominations and successfully sought ways of evading
the restriction of its faculty to Baptists. The
Disciples Divinity House was established, 1894, in affiliation
with the university and its divinity school,
and at once a large number of students came, many of
whom were mature men already in the ministry but
eager for graduate study. Through all these means,
by the end of the period here under consideration, the
educational average of ministers among the Disciples
had been greatly raised and their intellectual horizons
vastly widened. The improvement of the colleges
was one of the causes and also one of the consequences
of this.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Higher Criticism</span></h3>
<p>The old differences of opinion about the organ and
the missionary society continued, but there was no
longer any interest in controversy about them. The
opposing element ceased to cooperate with the &ldquo;progressives&rdquo;
and was moving toward separation, which
had become an accomplished fact, for all practical purposes,
years before it was registered by the separate
listing of the statistics of the &ldquo;Churches of Christ&rdquo; in
the religious census of 1906.</p>
<p>New issues arose which afforded topics for lively
debate in the papers, at preachers&rsquo; meetings, and at
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
the Congresses which met annually after 1899. Chief
among these were higher criticism, the reception of
the unimmersed, and federation. Since federation was
the only one of these that called for collective action,
and since it had very strong support as soon as it was
proposed, it had full and frank discussion in the conventions
also, as the other two questions did not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Higher criticism,&rdquo; or the study of the Bible by
critical methods of historical and literary analysis,
began in Europe early in the nineteenth century. By
the middle of the century, controversy had grown hot,
especially because the new method did not assume the
inerrancy of the Bible, as the older orthodoxy did, and
because some of the results of research cast doubt upon
the historicity of some parts of the Bible. American
scholars reacted, positively or negatively, to the higher
criticism during the two decades after the Civil War.
It became fairly well known by name, though not well
understood, and there were some famous heresy trials.
But Disciples did not become generally aware of it until
the 1890&rsquo;s. Professor J. W. McGarvey, stalwart
opponent of the new methods, began in 1893 his Biblical
Criticism Department in the <i>Christian Standard</i>.
With acumen and acrimony he denounced every new
conclusion or theory about such things as the authorship
of Deuteronomy and the latter part of
Isaiah or the date of Daniel as an attack upon the
faith and the work of &ldquo;enemies of the Bible.&rdquo; This
weekly page was widely read and much discussed. It
gave great publicity to the subject and, by its caustic
tone, its pungent personalities, and its identification of
higher criticism with infidelity, added bitterness to
what would in any case have been a very real divergence
of opinion. &ldquo;Few scholars and few students
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
were permanently influenced by the department,&rdquo; says
McGarvey&rsquo;s biographer and long-time associate, W. C.
Morro.</p>
<p>Disciples were vitally interested in this battle of the
Book, for they had always claimed to be, in a peculiar
sense, a Bible people. Many of them remembered the
first of Alexander Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;rules of interpretation&rdquo;:
in studying any book of the Bible, &ldquo;consider
first the historical circumstances of the book&mdash;the
order, the title, the author, the date, the place, and
the occasion of it.&rdquo; The young men who had been
going to the Eastern universities and seminaries had
become acquainted with the new methods of Bible
study, which were directed to these very questions.
The opening of the University of Chicago, just three
months before the beginning of Professor McGarvey&rsquo;s
antibiblical-criticism page, gave an immense impetus
to this trend, for its president, Dr. W. R. Harper, was
the most conspicuous exponent of these new methods
in the United States, with extraordinary gifts for
teaching and for publicity as well as for research. It
might almost be said that it was Dr. Harper who put
higher criticism on the map in the Middle West. Dr.
Herbert L. Willett, who had been a student under
Harper at Yale, became a colleague in his Semitic Department
at Chicago and dean of the Disciples Divinity
House. During several years he devoted much
of his time to extension lecturing and the holding of
institutes on the Bible. His popularity and success
in this field were sensational. For most Disciples,
Willett became the personal embodiment and symbol
of the new biblical learning. He carried the flag with
complete boldness, and his brilliant and winsome figure
became a shining mark for the counterattack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>The papers were inevitably involved in the higher
criticism controversy. The <i>Christian Standard&rsquo;s</i> position
was never in doubt. It was against it, not only
on Professor McGarvey&rsquo;s page, but on every other
page as well. The <i>Christian-Evangelist</i> was cautiously
liberal editorially. Its editor was not a technical
scholar in this field, but his mind was always
alert to discover new truth. He was hospitable to the
critical methods and was not alarmed by their results,
even though he did not personally accept all of them.
For several years he had Dr. Willett write for the
paper the weekly article on the Sunday school lesson.
This showed editorial courage, rather than caution,
but it was part of a consistent editorial policy that did
as much as a university could have done for the education
of the Disciples.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Rethinking Baptism</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Open membership&rdquo; had few advocates during the
period under consideration, but there had already begun
to be lively discussion of baptism in relation to
the problem of union. When Thomas Campbell wrote
the <i>Declaration and Address</i>&mdash;the event marked by
the 1909 centennial as the beginning of the Disciples&mdash;he
had not yet adopted the immersion of believers as
part of the basis of union and communion. But after
that practice was adopted by the Brush Run Church,
it became an integral part of the program of the Campbells
and it was a pivotal point in Scott&rsquo;s technique of
evangelism. The &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; in Kentucky generally
practiced immersion but considered it a matter of
opinion and did not insist upon it. Those who merged
with the Disciples yielded on this point and became
strict immersionists. Campbell&rsquo;s reply to the &ldquo;Lunenburg
letter&rdquo; showed that he regarded the pious unimmersed
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
as Christians. Later developments showed
that he would also commune with them as Christians.
But he would not have favored admitting them as
members, even if such a proposal had been made.</p>
<p>The first Disciple to argue for the admission of the
unimmersed was Dr. L. L. Pinkerton, in 1868. Pinkerton,
a medical doctor as well as a preacher, was a remarkably
free spirit and may be called the first thorough
&ldquo;liberal&rdquo; among the Disciples. He also challenged
the theory of the inerrancy of the Bible, though
he probably never heard of the higher criticism. Apparently
no other Disciple of his time shared his views
about either baptism or the Bible, except John
Shackleford, co-editor with him of the <i>Independent
Monthly</i>, a breezy magazine which lived less than two
years.</p>
<p>W. T. Moore, a missionary in England for the Foreign
Christian Missionary Society, about 1885 became
minister of West London Tabernacle, an independent
church having many unimmersed members. Defending
himself against criticism in a convention to which
he was reporting during a visit back home, he suggested
that baptism might cease to be a barrier to
union if it were agreed to recognize as baptized persons
those who had already been sprinkled, whether as
infants or as adults, but to practice only immersion
thenceforth. In spite of the high regard in which he
was held, this opportunistic proposal found little favor.
At the Congress of Disciples in 1901, Dr. Moore
renewed and elaborated this proposal, that a united
church be formed at once with all Christians as members
and that only immersion should be practiced
thereafter.</p>
<p>Robert L. Cave, an eloquent Virginian, who was pastor
of Central Christian Church, St. Louis, in 1889 issued
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
a pronunciamento widely at variance with the
generally accepted views of Disciples, and of other
evangelical Christians, on many points and demanded
a vote of confidence on that basis. Failing to get it,
he withdrew, followed by nearly half of the members,
and established the Non-Sectarian Church. This was
the outstanding heresy case of the period. But Dr.
Cave&rsquo;s rather casual treatment of baptism was such
a small item in the sum of his heresies that it was
scarcely noticed, and the whole episode produced a
conservative reaction even in the minds of moderately
progressive leaders. The editor of the <i>Christian-Evangelist</i>
at once launched a doctrinal revival, the
permanent record of which is the volume entitled, <i>The
Old Faith Restated</i>. Dr. Cave&rsquo;s advocacy did more
to retard than to advance the acceptance of liberal
ideas, including ideas about baptism.</p>
<p>In the 1890&rsquo;s the religious papers began to print
contributions discussing the function of baptism and
questioning whether it is indispensable. R. T. Matthews,
a professor at Drake, said that some of the unimmersed
&ldquo;are in essential union with Christ.&rdquo; John
Shackleford denied McGarvey&rsquo;s statement, in the first
edition of his <i>Commentary on Acts</i>, that &ldquo;faith without
immersion is dead.&rdquo; J. J. Haley, when pressed
to declare categorically whether he thought baptism
necessary, gave the Delphic answer that baptism is
&ldquo;as necessary as an ordinance can be, <i>considering
what an ordinance is</i>.&rdquo; Thomas Munnell, former missionary
secretary and one of the most honored veterans,
wrote a long article, in the <i>New Christian Quarterly</i>,
April, 1894, arguing that the requirement of
baptism be waived in the interest of union. In the
correspondence columns of the weeklies, there were
expressions of the opinion that a Christian union movement
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
which excludes from its churches a large proportion
of those whom it regards as Christians is both
illogical and futile. These were the opinions of a
small minority, and there were vigorous replies. In
1901 Dr. H. L. Willett published a little book, <i>Our
Plea for Union and the Present Crisis</i>, which was a
bold argument for open membership.</p>
<p>Along with much discussion, there was some action,
but only a little within this period. J. M. Philputt
was minister of a church on 119th St., New York,
which from about 1890 to 1900 received the unimmersed
as &ldquo;members of the congregation,&rdquo; not of the
church. &ldquo;We receive them,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;not as
Disciples of Christ but simply as Christians.&rdquo; This
distinction proved embarrassing. The practice drew
too much criticism and it was abandoned. Similar
&ldquo;associate membership&rdquo; arrangements were practiced
for some time at South Broadway, Denver (B. B.
Tyler); at Central, Denver (W. B. Craig); at Shelbyville,
Kentucky; and elsewhere. At Hyde Park, Chicago
(now University Church of Disciples of Christ),
Dr. E. S. Ames in 1903 led the church into receiving
unimmersed persons as &ldquo;members of the congregation.&rdquo;
Though the distinction between the two classes
of members seldom came to attention it was not
formally abolished until 1919 when the church became,
<i>de jure</i> as well as <i>de facto</i>, an open-membership
church. Long before that, in 1906, the Monroe Street
Church, Chicago, of which Charles C. Morrison was
pastor, had become the first church among the Disciples
to receive into full membership the unimmersed
members of other evangelical churches. When Morrison
took over the <i>Christian Century</i> in 1908, he
promptly made it an outspoken champion of liberal
views, including open membership.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>As the last item in the record of changing views on
baptism within this period, it may be noted that at the
Centennial Convention at Pittsburgh, 1909, Dr. S. H.
Church, a grandson of Walter Scott, delivered an address
in which he held that baptism is a matter of
opinion in regard to which there should be individual
liberty.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Federation</span></h3>
<p>The movement for federation among the Protestant
denominations quickly won the favor of all Disciples
except the most rigidly noncooperative, but these
were many, and their voices were loud. The impulse
to federation came from the new sense of the social
responsibilities of the churches which became acute in
the latter part of the nineteenth century. It was first
proposed by the Presbyterian General Assembly as a
means of getting some united action by Protestants
without compromising their denominational differences
and independence. After a decade of desultory
discussion and some local organizations, a national
Federation of Churches and Christian Workers was
formed in 1901. The next year this body proposed a
conference of official representatives of denominations
to consider the feasibility of a federation of the denominations
as such. It was at this point that the
matter came before the Disciples through a brief
speech by the secretary, Dr. E. B. Sanford, at the
Omaha convention in 1902, following an eloquent
address on Christian union by E. L. Powell. A resolution
of approval was introduced by J. H. Garrison,
who supposed&mdash;na&iuml;vely, as he afterward said&mdash;that it
would be adopted unanimously. J. A. Lord, editor of
the <i>Christian Standard</i>, objected that joining such an
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
association would be &ldquo;recognizing the denominations.&rdquo;
The resolution was adopted, with only a small
opposing vote. But the war was on, with the two
papers already ranged on opposite sides. For the next
four or five years, federation was the hot spot of controversy
in conventions, ministers&rsquo; meetings, and the
press. The Disciples were represented, however, at
the Interchurch Conference on Federation, at Carnegie
Hall, New York City, in November, 1905, where a constitution
was drafted. A mass meeting called during
the Norfolk convention in 1907 approved the constitution,
with only one dissenting voice, and elected representatives
in the Federal Council of the Churches of
Christ in America. The first meeting of the Federal
Council was held at Philadelphia, February 2, 1908.</p>
<p>Thus the Disciples were in the Federal Council from
its beginning. They also cooperated from the start
with the Foreign Missions Conference of North America
(1907) and the Home Missions Council (1908).
Union as an objective had not been forgotten; but,
while there were barriers to immediate union, cooperation
with other Christians in the promotion of practical
Christian ends had come to seem, to the great
body of Disciples, both safe and wise.</p>
<p>The completion of the first hundred years was celebrated
by a Centennial Convention, at Pittsburgh,
October, 1909. This was a gathering of unprecedented
and still unequaled size. It quickened the interest of
Disciples in their own history and heritage. Coming
so soon after they had embarked upon these large
ventures in cooperation, it directed their minds not
only to the numerical and institutional success of their
own movement but also to the path of common service
and the hope of unity that lay ahead. It was a true
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
instinct that directed the choice of the centennial of
the <i>Declaration and Address</i> for this observance
rather than, for example, the promulgation of Walter
Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;uniform, authoritative method of proclaiming
the gospel,&rdquo; or the dissolution of the Mahoning
Association. This choice expressed the feeling that
the essence of the movement is not in its separateness
or in its &ldquo;particular ecclesiastical order,&rdquo; but in its
call for union upon the will to do the will of Christ.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="large">GROWING INTO MATURITY, 1909-45</span></h2>
<p>Growth in numbers had been very rapid during
the first eighty years. It was not unusual to hear
the confident prediction that at this rate they would
soon &ldquo;take the country,&rdquo; and it seemed disloyalty to
doubt that the rate of increase would continue. But
the population of the country was also growing very
rapidly, though not so rapidly as the Disciples. So
long as there was an open frontier&mdash;that is, until about
1890&mdash;and even later, while the heavy westward migration
continued, the Disciples outran the general
population increase. But so also did the Methodists
and Baptists. Immigration from Europe brought
tremendous reinforcements to Roman Catholics and
Lutherans, none to Disciples; and Disciples gained by
conversion almost none of these immigrants or their
children. The nation was becoming increasingly
urban, while the Disciples remained more rural than
other large communions. Inevitably there were diminishing
returns in growth.</p>
<p>There was a high point in 1910. It was higher still
in 1914, with an abrupt drop of nearly 300,000 to 1915,
and a fair rate of growth thereafter. An improvement
in statistical methods probably explains the greater
part, though perhaps not all, of the apparent loss in
1915. Certainly there was no great disastrous event
in that year. Perhaps some of the &ldquo;Churches of
Christ&rdquo; were included in the count until 1915. Here
are the figures since 1900:</p>

<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Improving the Machinery</span></h3>
<p>With the recognition of many fields of responsibility
besides home and foreign missions and the consequent
multiplication of societies, each having an annual
&ldquo;special day&rdquo; to promote its work and raise its funds,
a good deal of rivalry and confusion ensued. There
were not enough days to go around. For example, the
Foreign Society bitterly opposed the claim of the new
American Christian Education Society (1903) upon
the third Sunday in January as Education Day, because
this interfered with the exclusive occupancy of
January and February in preparation for Foreign
Missions Day, the first Sunday in March; but it could
do nothing about it because the latter was an independent
and theoretically coordinate society. Moreover,
the conventions were conventions of the societies
rather than of the churches.</p>
<p>The first step toward remedying this condition was
the appointment of a &ldquo;calendar committee,&rdquo; at Buffalo
in 1906, to devise a plan for reducing the number of
special days. There was no immediate result. At New
Orleans in 1908, the constitution of the American
Christian Missionary Society was amended to provide
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
for a delegate convention in which every church,
whether contributing or not, should have elected representatives.
So much parliamentary confusion attended
this action that it was not carried into effect.
The Centennial Convention of 1909 appointed a standing
committee to consider unifying all missionary and
philanthropic work under one or two boards. The
committee&rsquo;s intimation that it would recommend a
strictly delegate convention to which all societies
should report touched off a long and heated discussion.
&ldquo;Delegate convention&rdquo; became, for the more
conservative element, a symbol of apostasy, as &ldquo;higher
criticism&rdquo; and &ldquo;federation&rdquo; had been a few years
earlier.</p>
<p>The formal report of the committee was made at
Louisville in 1912, and the vote was almost unanimous
in favor of a general convention to be composed of
elected and accredited delegates from the churches.
The convention of the following year, at Toronto&mdash;which
was supposed to be composed of delegates but
was not, because few churches sent them&mdash;ratified the
delegate plan which it failed to exemplify. In subsequent
conventions also there were few delegates. The
delegate system failed not because of opposition but
because of indifference to it. The vast majority of
churches did not elect delegates, and habitual convention-goers
continued to go whether they were delegates
or not. At Kansas City, 1917, a new constitution was
adopted, which, while retaining the delegate feature,
made it meaningless by giving equal voting power to
all members of churches who were in attendance. (It
was like having an elected Congress with the provision
that any citizen who cares to attend its sessions shall
have all the powers of a congressman.) But with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
large and representative &ldquo;Committee on Recommendations&rdquo;
serving as an upper house, the plan works surprisingly
well.</p>
<p>A national publication society, to be owned by the
brotherhood and operated for its benefit, seemed desirable
to many. A committee was appointed in 1907
to study the problem. Mr. R. A. Long solved it by
agreeing, in December, 1909, to buy all the stock of the
Christian Publishing Company, publishers of the
<i>Christian-Evangelist</i> and of books and Sunday school
materials, and place it in the hands of a self-perpetuating
board of directors, all profits to be appropriated to
the missionary and other enterprises of the Disciples.
The fears of a regimentation of opinion by an
&ldquo;official&rdquo; journal and publishing house have proved
groundless. The Christian Board of Publication is, in
fact, no more &ldquo;official&rdquo; than are the Disciples&rsquo; colleges,
which have exactly the same kind of ownership
and control. But the brotherhood does get the profits,
which have totaled much more than Mr. Long&rsquo;s
original gift.</p>
<p>Mr. Long was also the prime mover in, and the
largest donor to, the Men and Millions Movement, the
aim of which was to enlist a thousand men and women
for religious service and to raise six million dollars for
missions and colleges. The campaign, beginning in
1914, was interrupted by the war, but its financial goal
was finally reached.</p>
<p>The unification of missionary agencies had been suggested
at least as early as 1892 and discussed at intervals
thereafter. Before it was accomplished, the
separate societies had already reformed some of the
evils of the old system by establishing a joint budget
committee to make the securing of funds for the various
interests cooperative rather than competitive, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
by stressing weekly giving for missions as part of each
congregation&rsquo;s financial system instead of relying upon
spasms of appeal on special days. Conditions
caused by World War I doubtless precipitated the consolidation
of the societies. In 1919 the home and foreign
missionary societies, the Christian Woman&rsquo;s
Board of Missions, the boards of church extension and
ministerial relief, and the National Benevolent Association
were merged to form the United Christian
Missionary Society. F. W. Burnham was its president
until 1929.</p>
<p>Some Disciples, without being opposed to societies
on principle, had long been critical of much that the
societies did and the way they did it&mdash;their &ldquo;cold institutionalism&rdquo;
and &ldquo;bureaucratic methods&rdquo; and their
concern with so many things other than winning converts
by the simple plea of faith, repentance, and baptism
and organizing churches according to the ancient
order. The United Society fell heir to these hostilities
and aroused more. One result was an increase in the
number of &ldquo;independent agencies.&rdquo; These have a
loose bond among themselves as the &ldquo;Associated Free
Agencies.&rdquo; The <i>Christian Standard</i>, chief journalistic
critic of the organized work, publicizes these
agencies and, together with the Christian Restoration
Association, lends them its support. The annual
North American Christian Convention appeals primarily
to those who stand aloof from the United
Society and support the independent agencies.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Widening Educational Horizons</span></h3>
<p>The remarkable improvement of the Disciples&rsquo; colleges
has been an indication of the widening intellectual
outlook of the communion and also one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
causes of it. The increase of endowments was only one
aspect of the improvement, but an essential one. In
the first thirty years of this century, the total of their
endowments rose from $3,300,000 to $33,000,000. There
was similar betterment of buildings, libraries, and
equipment. Academic standards were raised, and
faculties were better trained for their specific tasks.
The transformation of Bethany College, beginning
with the administration of President T. A. Cramblet,
from the decadent and moribund state into which it
had fallen to its present admirable and flourishing
condition, is an example of what several colleges
achieved. Drake, Butler, Phillips, and Texas Christian
University gained honorable prominence in their
states and beyond. These four developed graduate
schools for the ministry, or raised toward full graduate
status the departments they already had. The
College of the Bible, at Lexington, entered upon a
new epoch. Transylvania, always prominent in Kentucky,
resumed the ancient name which identified it
as &ldquo;the oldest college west of the Alleghenies.&rdquo;
There were also casualties among the colleges. As
costs increased and academic requirements stiffened,
some were forced to close down. Cotner was one
of these.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, much larger numbers of the younger
ministers have been taking advantage of the resources
of other universities and seminaries. Hundreds have
gone to Yale Divinity School, hundreds more to the
Divinity School of the University of Chicago and the
Disciples Divinity House. The pastors of the great
majority of the larger churches at the present time are
men who have had such education. Likewise the
faculties of the Disciples&rsquo; colleges and of their graduate
schools for the ministry are composed, almost
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
without exception, of university-trained men. The
&ldquo;cultural isolation&rdquo; of the Disciples has definitely
ended.</p>
<p>The Congresses of the Disciples, which began in
1899 and were held annually until about 1925, were a
valuable means of adult education for ministers. These
were gatherings for the discussion of religious, theological,
and social problems which could not properly
come before the conventions. They were characterized
by great freedom of utterance. At first, all phases
of opinion were represented, but as the more conservative
element gradually dropped out, the congresses
lost much of their value.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Liberal Tendencies</span></h3>
<p>Through all these agencies, the liberalizing effects
of the newer learning were widely diffused. One
aspect of this was that a great number of ministers
accepted the so-called &ldquo;modern view&rdquo; of the Bible,
based upon historical and critical methods of study,
in place of the theory of inerrancy and level inspiration.
Proof texts lost something of their finality. The
pattern of the primitive church seemed somewhat less
sharply drawn, and the duty of restoring it in every
detail less axiomatic. Christian truth and duty were
seen as far more extensive, and far less simple, than
the conversion formula and the restoration of the
ancient order as these had been conceived. In this
atmosphere of opinion, the stress was upon union,
while the concept of restoration seemed to require reinterpretation
to give it continued validity. All this
had begun to happen in the previous period; but now
it happened on a large scale, reaching many important
pulpits, the colleges, the missionary executives, the
missionaries themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>It was no longer possible to say that only a little
coterie of young men held and taught these disturbing
ideas. Their spread could not plausibly be charged
to the Campbell Institute, though this provided a free
forum for its members. The Campbell Institute began
in 1896 as a company of fifteen young men who had
done some graduate work, or were still doing it. It
was organized, as its constitution says, &ldquo;to enable its
members to help each other to a riper scholarship by
a free discussion of vital problems; to promote quiet
self-culture and the development of a higher spirituality
both among the members and among the churches
with which they shall come in contact; and to encourage
productive work with a view of making contributions
of permanent value to the literature and thought
of the Disciples of Christ.&rdquo; The young men grew older,
and their number increased to several hundred. The institute&rsquo;s
meetings were all open to the public, its membership
was opened to any college graduate who cared
to enroll, and a wide variety of theological opinions
found expression on its programs and in its organ,
the <i>Scroll</i>. It never pulled a wire to get one of its
members into a position of honor or leadership. Still,
it was and is of some significance as an incentive to untrammeled
thinking, an organization liberal enough
to be equally hospitable to liberal and conservative
opinion.</p>
<p>The <i>Christian Century</i>, immediately after C. C.
Morrison became its proprietor and editor in 1908,
became the exponent of a more liberal theology than
had ever been voiced by any Disciples&rsquo; paper, an
equally liberal social outlook, and the strongest possible
emphasis upon the unity of all Christians.
Gradually, and quite definitely from about 1920, it became
an undenominational journal with a large constituency
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
among all communions. The prestige that
it gained in the wider field and its complete editorial
independence gave it great influence among thoughtful
Disciples as a stimulus to their own thinking even
if they did not go all the way with it.</p>
<p>The Association for the Promotion of Christian
Unity, which grew out of a meeting called by Peter
Ainslie at the 1910 Topeka convention, of which he
was president, stressed the things which the Disciples
held in common with other communions and, through
many years, sought ways of cultivating this fellowship.
While the association itself did not espouse open
membership, it did not envision union by the universal
acceptance of the Disciples&rsquo; &ldquo;historic plea&rdquo; for the
immersion of penitent believers for the remission of
sins and the restoration of the pattern of the New
Testament church as they had understood it. But Dr.
Ainslie, who was president of the association for many
years, became an outspoken advocate of open membership,
which he called &ldquo;recognizing the equality of all
Christians before God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Missionaries in certain foreign fields, especially
China, were reported to be too little concerned with
baptizing converts and too much involved in activities
other than pressing the &ldquo;distinctive plea&rdquo; of the Disciples.
Whether or not they actually received Chinese
Methodists or Presbyterians who had no other church
home, remained a disputed question even after a self-appointed
investigator had gone to China and reported
that they did.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Conservative Reaction</span></h3>
<p>From all these circumstances there arose a vigorous
campaign of criticism against all the agencies that
seemed implicated in this liberal tendency. The attack
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
upon Transylvania University and the College
of the Bible, long a citadel of orthodoxy but now
manned by younger men of university training, was
spearheaded by the Bible College League in 1916. It
failed to accomplish its purpose. The &ldquo;Medbury
resolution,&rdquo; passed by the 1918 convention, demanded
that the Foreign Society forbid the reception of unimmersed
persons into mission churches in China. An
explanation by Frank Garrett that what looked from a
distance like open membership in China was really
not that, because the mission communities were not
fully organized churches, brought the repeal of the
Medbury resolution.</p>
<p>But criticism was only checked, not silenced. The
&ldquo;restorationists&rdquo; organized the New Testament Tract
Society to spread &ldquo;sound doctrine.&rdquo; The Board of
Managers of the new United Society adopted an
affirmation of allegiance to the &ldquo;historic position&rdquo; of
the Disciples, including immersion, signed it themselves,
and required all missionaries to sign it. The
1922 convention adopted the &ldquo;Sweeney resolution,&rdquo;
which approved this action and put teeth into it. A
&ldquo;peace committee,&rdquo; in 1924, failed to agree, and the
<i>Christian Standard</i> led in organizing the Christian
Restoration Association and began to publish the
<i>Restoration Herald</i>. The Oklahoma City convention
of 1925 adopted a resolution by which it ordered
the recall of any missionary who &ldquo;has committed himself
to belief in the reception of unimmersed persons
into church membership,&rdquo; and voted to send a commission
to the Orient to find the facts. The commission
reported that it found no open membership in
China, and the Board of Managers officially interpreted
the Oklahoma City resolution as &ldquo;not intended to invade
the right of private judgment, but only to apply
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
to such an open agitation as would prove divisive.&rdquo;
The critics repudiated both the report and the interpretation
and, when defeated in the 1926 Memphis
convention, called the first &ldquo;North American Christian
Convention&rdquo; for October, 1927. This convention, repeated
annually, has continued to be the rallying place
of the opponents of the United Society.</p>
<p>While open membership has been thrust into the
foreground in the controversy between the United
Society and its critics, the society does not avow sympathy
with that practice and refuses to admit that
this is the real issue. But it cannot be doubted that
there are two contrasting views as to the basis of the
Christian unity which Disciples seek and the nature
and scope of the restoration at which they aim. Under
this difference lie two views of the Bible, and from it
flow differences of emphasis upon baptism. The admission
of the unimmersed is openly defended by relatively
few, but quietly practiced by a good many.
Still more are restrained from it, not by their own
convictions, but by the feeling that at present it would
promote division rather than unity.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">An Ecumenical Outlook</span></h3>
<p>All Protestantism has been seeking ways of cooperation
and dreaming of unity during the past forty
years. In these efforts the Disciples have had their
full share, and their hope of unity has been more than
a dream. The revived conception of an ecumenical
church is congenial to their best tradition and has
stirred them to reconsider the ways in which they may
help in its realization.</p>
<p>The Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in
America has been the foremost cooperative agency
since 1905. A Disciple suggested that name, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
Disciples had a part in its organization and have been
well represented in its leadership. Jesse Bader has
been at the head of its department of evangelism for
many years. Herbert L. Willett was in charge of its
Midwestern office for a considerable period. Edgar
DeWitt Jones has served as its president. The Disciples
have entered heartily into cooperative educational
work in foreign missions and into comity arrangements
both at home and abroad for the allotment
of fields and the distribution of forces to prevent
duplication and competition. A Disciple missionary,
Samuel Guy Inman, has been the leading spirit in the
Committee on Cooperation in Latin America. The
Interchurch World Movement, which aimed at a revival
of Christian work and the strengthening of all
Christian institutions immediately after World War I,
was overambitious and became a costly fiasco. Disciples
shared in this, too, and paid their part of the
staggering deficit.</p>
<p>What is more explicitly called the Ecumenical Movement
began with a World Conference on Foreign
Missions, at New York City in 1900. This led to a
similar conference in Edinburgh in 1910. The Disciples
were not represented in the organization or on
the program of either of these. In the minds of the
promoters of these conferences, they were still an unknown
people, or a minor sect. Some Disciples attended,
however, as unofficial observers. Beginning
with the problem of unity in missions, the Ecumenical
Movement expanded to become &ldquo;Life and Work&rdquo;
(Stockholm, 1925, and Oxford, 1937) and &ldquo;Faith and
Order&rdquo; (Lausanne, 1927, and Edinburgh, 1937). The
problems of Christianity in relation to other world
religions were studied at the Jerusalem Conference,
1930, and those of the &ldquo;younger churches&rdquo; of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
mission lands at Madras, 1939. In all these ecumenical
gatherings, the Disciples have had a recognized place
and have taken an active part. They have also
recorded their adherence to the World Council of
Churches, which grew out of the Oxford and Edinburgh
conferences of 1937.</p>
<p>Sunday school work had an undenominational aspect
at its very beginning, early in the nineteenth
century. Disciples took part in the International Sunday
School Association, organized in 1872, and adopted
its uniform lessons. B. B. Tyler was its president in
1902. Other organizations arose to develop more
modern phases of religious education. Robert M. Hopkins
was prominent in the Sunday School Council
from the start, and he was chairman of the executive
committee of the International Council of Religious
Education for eleven years after its formation by the
union of the old International Association and the
Sunday School Council in 1922. Roy G. Ross is now
executive secretary of the International Council.
Many other Disciples, experts in various phases of this
work, have borne heavy responsibilities in these organizations,
especially in the latest and most comprehensive
one.</p>
<p>In brief, no communion has been more active in all
the cooperative enterprises of the churches in recent
years, or more sympathetic with the ecumenical trend
toward thinking less of the churches and more of the
Church.</p>
<p>The bitter experiences of World War II have accentuated
the common responsibilities of all the churches
in the face of a resurgent paganism and world-wide
suffering. Disciples have participated in the counsels
of Christians on the problems of war and peace and
have not shunned their special burdens. They raised
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
a million-dollar emergency fund, furnished their
quota of chaplains with the armed forces, made provision
for their conscientious objectors. The Drake
Conference on &ldquo;The Church and the New World
Mind&rdquo; was part of their contribution to the study of
postwar problems.</p>
<h3 class="generic"><span class="sc">Rethinking the Disciples</span></h3>
<p>The central body of opinion among Disciples cherishes
the watchwords &ldquo;union&rdquo; and &ldquo;restoration,&rdquo;
about which the whole movement has developed. But
it recognizes that changed conditions and widened
horizons may require a reconsideration of the program
of union and of the meaning of restoration. It is not
the impatience of youth but the voice of experience
that rejects a static and unchangeable system. J. H.
Garrison was editor and editor emeritus of the <i>Christian-Evangelist</i>
for sixty years. In the last contribution
written with his own hand, published on April 11,
1929, being then in his eighty-eighth year, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are we Disciples, who started out a century ago
to plead for Christian unity, losing our zeal for
this holy cause, or are we losing confidence in ourselves
as fit instruments of our Lord for promoting
it? I think it would be a good move for the
president of our international convention to appoint
at once a committee to study and report on
the question: What changes in the way of addition
or subtraction are demanded among the
Disciples to make their plea more efficient, either
in its substance or in the manner of its presentation
to the world?</p>
<p>The religious world today is very different from
what it was a century ago. Science has given us
a different conception of nature and of the universe.
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
Biblical criticism has changed for most
of us our view of the Bible, making it not a less
but a more valuable book for the student of religion.
This increase of light is evident in every
department of knowledge. Is it possible that all
these changes do not require any readjustment in
the matter and method of a plea for unity inaugurated
more than a century ago?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggestion bore fruit, a few years later, in the
appointment of a Commission on Restudy of the Disciples
of Christ. Since 1935, this commission has carried
on a study of the past and the present with a
view to finding what readjustments may profitably
be made for the future. This is only one of many
groups which are concerned that the Disciples shall
not simply be &ldquo;a great people,&rdquo; as they sometimes
proudly and truly claim that they are, but shall go
forward to the fulfillment of their highest purposes.
There is yet much light to break from God&rsquo;s Word
and from the teachings of their own experience.</p>
